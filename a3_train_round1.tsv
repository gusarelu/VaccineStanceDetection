1	Its like my first time seeing people be more afraid of the vaccine than the actual virus
0	vaccines dont work.
0	B ullshit all this is fken planets above our heads..don't be stupid cause when God comes ur were stupid and gotten a number from the devil..and put foreign DNA in ur blood.the ones who didn't will rise
1	People who refuse to get vaccinated are making it impossible for all the vaccinated ones to get their life back to normal.
0	The vaccines are a load of shite.
1	Vaccines are an incredible thing and I'm grateful that we have them
0	You are 100% correct we do not have a vaccine for covid.  We have an effective therapeutic that's it
0	It's a cold, relax fascists
1	If we went through a classic parliamentary shuttle, we would still be in a 3-week lockdown every two months. We have to be reactive, we are in an exceptional situation. There are already 11 compulsory vaccines, so #Vaccinateyourself and basta!
1	At this point anti-vaxxing is natural selection at its finest and probably quickest.
1	Basically I got the vaccine because I am educated and smart!
1	Thanks to the life-saving work by scientists and our government’s top medical experts, we have COVID-19 vaccines to protect us. This is what happens when we trust science, and hardworking doctors and researchers set out to do big things.
1	everyone should take it, I did.
1	Good health vaccine from covid 19
0	So trust your body and its immunity power. No need for vaccination
1	If you choose to not get the vaccine you’re separating families (myself included) for years potentially.
1	I really love vaccines, especcialy now with covid
1	Hope you have had your 3rd booster shot too as that is important
1	The good news is that nationwide", ' new confirmed hospital admissions in November are down 45% year over year from 2020. I attribute this in part to vaccines'
0	You know they just paused the johnson and johnson vaccine because people were dying of rare blood clots.
1	I just don’t know how people can not consider others when choosing not getting the vaccine. For me, obviously was trying to protect myself and my husband, but another huge factor was protecting others in my community. I have elderly neighbors, immunocompromised neighbors, neighbors with small children… what about them? Don’t they matter? Shouldn’t we do what we can to keep each other safe during this pandemic? Isn’t it the least we can do for one another?
1	Lord help us  this is beyond scary
1	Yes for vaccination. Getting the vaccine gives us some peace of mind too.
0	This video was excellent, it’s told me that I’ve made the right choice on not getting the vaccine. Thank you for this :)
1	Hundreds of millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines under the most intensive safety monitoring program in U.S. history.
1	Its so funny how quickly covid is disappearing because of sheep waking up..
1	I'm so grateful for vaccines. And so glad that new techniques are making them more effective and faster to make!
1	Like all vaccines any such SARS-CoV-19 vaccine will be beneficial and will not cause any harm. Indeed it will prevent harm.
0	I'm against untested medications which offer me no benefits because I have natural immunity. The risk/reward would be non-existent for me to take this shite.
1	Get the entire world vaccinated against COVID!
1	i was actually one of the people in the moderna coronavirus vaccine trials who got this vaccine! i was so hyped when i read this! i also know i didnt get the placebo either because my test came back positive for covid antibodies. but im still taking the same precautions just in case.
1	This is what scares me. My husband is military and I'm not a fan of the idea of him being used as a guinea pig.
1	America is great because the willfully ignorant can lawfully assemble to demonstrate that they have the freedom to be a grave hazard to public health.
0	I had to care for a patient who died from taking this vaccine,  and now they are trying to force us to take it, we worked for over a year with no adequate ppe which we still do not have, and no compensation...please protect us.
0	You don't hear about the side effects but because anytime it gets posted up, it gets ripped down
0	So what about the people who are in the hospital with blood clots or the ones who have died after getting the shot? Lab rats
0	Yeah it’s no longer a conspiracy when it’s actually happening.
0	Funny story: I was never anti-vaxx until this specific vaccine. Weird. I know.
0	The vaxxed RIP
0	Regular vaccines yes, these experimental ones; hell no
1	First of all people are a little bit too sensitive and second of all in comparison to something that happened in history there's nothing wrong with that because if it relates to the current situations that's going on it's totally relevant how that hurt someone's feelings is beyond me, its because it was a terrible thing and we should learn from history instead of repeating it
0	France with 95% of vaccinated adults has almost reached 500k contamination per day right now. Last year at the same period it was at 10k per day
0	Look, if you want to take a vaccine, take it! That's your right and choice. Just as its my right to believe this vaccine is not necessary.
0	Patients with #cirrhosis can develop #COVID-19 after #CovidVaccine.
0	Sadly, he cannot seek compensation for his injury because of the liability protections for big pharma...wake up.
1	I think its a lot safer then COVID. Which people seem to forget. I’ve never seen someone ask about the long term effects of COVID
0	Not a vaccine if you can still get the virus, they labeled it wrong
1	Suddenly people that have no medical training are experts at containment of a global health emergency because Facebook
1	Dear Anti Vaxxers, JUST VACCINATE!!!!
1	The vaccine will reduce loss of life and will help to recover economic loss
0	Vaccines don't really stop infection, i got covid even tho I was vaxxed 2/3 weeks
1	CAUSE ITS GOOD FOR KIDS.
1	I don't support vaccine passports for average people but if you work in healthcare or nursing homes, I'm sorry but there's no place for you if you don't get vaccinated.
1	Give me the vaccine now!
1	People boycotting a vaccine but eat processed food daily XD
1	Yessssssss cant wait!
0	where there is risk there needs to be choice. simple as that.
1	Twitter is responsible for helping the narrative move smoothly along.  Pfizer vaccine good"
0	Leave the virus to your immune system
1	The vaccination helps us to avoid the worst ,if we get the infection after the second dose.Not that it can protect us from infection altogether.
0	Why is it that no one wants to talk about the documented side effects? People have good reasons for being hesitant!! Thank you, Senator Ron Johnson, for leading the fight in this regard!!
0	So far my natural immunity has protected me from at least two variants. Yes, and that’s without two, three, etc… “vaccoosters”.
1	Vaccinated and boostered. Was exposed over Christmas, tested positive and had only mild symptoms. So thankful.
0	During vaccination session: "patient, Does it guarantee immunity?  Doctor, only for the manufactures
1	It’s strange that people think that a vaccine that has helped millions of people will kill them but a virus hat has killed millions won’t
1	But it blows my mind that people are so worried about the small chance of an adverse reaction that they’d put their kids at risk for dangerous and preventable diseases
0	No it isn’t. I don’t care what mandates are made, anyone trying to force anything on me is getting smoked.
1	You’re an idiot, vaccines have saved millions of lives. Get out of your basement and get a fuse if reality.
0	I currently have covid. I would prefer having it compared to getting that specific vaccine.
0	Vaccines were never effective anyway.
0	I know more vaccinated ppl who have caught covid MULTIPLE TIMES, vs unvaccinated ppl i know who have NEVER gotten covid and have the antibodies their own bodies made and from monoclonal therapy. STOP pushing your vaccines and start pushing these therapies so we can get thru this!
1	Vaccines and boosters are what this type of virus needs to keep us protected.
0	No to vaccine passport and medical apertheid! The government has to respect individual's choices when it comes to health!!
1	I'm 16 years old, and I have taken the Pfizer vaccine. I didn't have any side effects on my first shot, but I did have a sore arm for the second shot. The pain disappeared a day after taking paracetamol.
1	Give everyone A vaccine and then let's worry about the details later. For now, more immunizations regardless of which one it is.
1	If I get another booster, can't everyone stay 12 feet farther away? #GetVaxxed
1	Literally. If the retarded boomers don’t want it, I’ll take it and be immune as their lungs crackle. Natural selection
1	The ignorant once again hurting the vulnerable, those who CAN'T get vaccinated for medical reasons
0	A vaccine for something with an incredibly high survival rate
1	Getting stressed about the unvaccinated.  This will never end if they don’t get vaccinated.
1	at first i was skeptical due to the sheer speed the vaccine was developed but after seeing millions get vaccinated with minor to non existent side effects i decided to go ahead with it.
1	you are doing and distributing vaccines booster COVID-19 make for more confident and safe for people.Thank you so much.
1	Vaccination is preferable as it makes life more manageable. As soon as the peak is over, one can then question more strongly whether there are enough mild courses without vaccination.
1	Look at the current 5G roll out map, And then compare it to the corona virus map. Voila!
1	Great information, just want the vaccine in my body!
1	Every dose matters for your child's health
0	do not allow these poor babies to be vaccinated
1	I got my vaccine - had a reaction because of my medical conditions - am still going to get my second vaccine because me getting COVID is way worse and you know helping other people not die?!
0	@MobilePunch If Unvaccinated people are a risk to Vaccinated people then that is clear evidence that the vaccine offers no protection and it doesn't work. So why then are more people being forced to take it when even vaccinated people can still spread it? Una no dey think?
0	Why do we call a Vaccine  when it does not work as a vaccine??   What is the meaning of vaccine?🤔🤔
1	I totally agree with vaccines, they save so many lives.
1	India’s cumulative vaccination coverage crosses 170 Crore landmark milestone
0	The "vaccinated" are still getting sick (therefore it is NOT a vaccine...)
0	I haven't had a flu shot since I was 8.my dad took me both of us were sick two days later neither have had it since 🙃
0	It is almost like the vaccine is a lie
1	I will be getting my covid shot in early February on the occasion of my 75th birthday because I don’t want to die just now. I’ll do that later at a time of my own choosing.
0	Patient: Does this vaccine provide immunity? Doctor: Only for the manufacturer.
0	He said it's less virulent so...why care? Let's just move on
0	If you live long enough, you'll know the side effects... this vaccine is not secure yet
0	I have myocarditis from the vaccine.
0	I am happy for everyone that wants this, but I'm not adding any other worries onto my plate... I'm healthy and gonna role au naturale & see what happens. I'll opt for the therapies, if I ever get sick. Good luck everyone!
1	thanks. All I’m saying is of the 4 1/2 million deaths from covid, far less than 1% of those are from fully vaccinated. Vaccines save lives, which is a fact.
1	Got my first dose Friday. I want to go back to normal.
1	The important information missing here is that underlying conditions is a major contributing factor to Covid deaths.  The vaccine would have helped.
0	My sister in law was 7 months pregnant and got Covid. Baby is healthy and she is still not vaccinated. Long term they don’t know the effects of the vaccine so they chose not to get vaccinated.
0	"For the first time in history, the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who haven't taken it."- Robert Malone MD
0	Vaccine nothing more than a bio weapon.. Pray for those who got it.
0	If it was either safe or worked ,they wouldn't have to constantly say it was safe and it works. On a side note,thousands of domestic flights shut down due to all the jabbed airline staff getting new variant.....
0	I’m not for vaccines and proud of it.
0	My son is vaccinated and still ended up very sick after getting Covid-19 he was out of school for over a week and scared all of us what is the point if people are still getting very sick
0	Disagree Corona Doesn't Exist
0	It's takes 12 years on average for full approval, ya know because that's the only way you test the LONG TERM side affects!
0	The vaccines have not been tested before approval. You sheeps are all part of the experiment!
0	How can I feel secure if the government signed a full disclaimers for vaccine manufacturers in case of side effects??
1	The vaccine helps prevent kids from getting COVID-19:
0	This is a disaster waiting to happen…
0	When I got vaccinated I actually got sick I didn't need to pretend
1	Happy to get my third short tomorrow!
1	I’ll get mine as soon as possible!!
0	I hope you are against all Covid 19 vaccine mandates-not just boosters!FDA tricked y’all into thinking they approved. Comirnaty does not exist. 22076 dead per cdc/Vaers.son kicked out of college. I’m thrilled he doesn’t have that shit in his body.don’t be sheep!digital id coming!
1	Vaccines decrease the transmission of Delta, the most pathogenic form of Covid.  I'm stupid enough to think that's a good thing.
0	"If you have to be persuaded, reminded pressured, lied to, incentivized, coerced, bullied, socially shamed, guilt-tripped, threatened, punished and criminalized ...

0	Question for media experts: why do mainstream shows like @24hPujadas don't say that Israel broke its record of severe covid patients despite 667 thousand 4th doses and with the Omicron variant? Is this religious or journalistic behaviour?
1	It's already been tested on the rich and powerful who cut the line to get it and that's how you know it's safe... I would get it in a heartbeat, it makes me so frustrated to think about doses possibly going to waste.
1	There you have it! A fully authorized life saving vaccine! Use it for fuck’s sake!
0	Other people don't have the right to control minds, that's our job! - CNN
1	Please just take the vaccine for the love of god!!!
1	These side effects may affect your child’s ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days.
0	But the covid vaccines appear not to be working. I will stick with my naturally acquired immunity and not risk the blood clots and strokes suffered by people I know just a week after receiving the vaccine. Ha, they refuse to see the connection.
1	Well he is truly an anti-vaccine dude because he refused to go to the hospital. What I don't understand are those antivaccine people going to the hospital. If you don't believe in science you shouldn go to the hospital just RIP.
0	I am never getting A vaccine ever
1	I have done my part, I chose to vaccinate. What about you? #vaccinated #Choosetovaccinate
0	It's not just about trusting the government, it's the media as well. If news outlets would report the news, instead of giving us their take on it, that would greatly help.
1	my whole family has covid right now luckily most of us are vaccinated and my mom and grandma are also boosted
0	When you're forcing well-meaning adults to do something they don't want to do, you're the bad guy. Always. No exceptions. Joe Biden is a bad guy, his entire administration are made up of bad people, and I hope the American people make it loud and clear that they will not be forced, threatened, or intimidated into doing things they do not want to do. This is the United States of America, a country founded on the values of Liberty and Justice. This is not a dictatorship, nor is it a cage full of rats in a laboratory. Protest. Go on strike. Be vocal. Say no.
1	I signed up for the vaccine as soon as I was eligible, my second shot isn't until the 20th. Sucks that they couldn't just wait until everybody who wanted the vaccine had a chance to get it.
0	Variants getting milder and milder, yet government in Canada are making the restrictions harsher and harsher.
0	Why continue a vaccination program that is killing over 40 people a day with an estimated death count of over 5000 in the US and over 7000 in Europe!?
1	Americans need to believe in science and actually comprehend it.
1	To those who are ONLY looking at the NUMBER of COVID-19 cases to doubt vaccine effectiveness: Please ALSO look at hospitalisation rates, deaths, ICU occupancy and specifically number of Category 3, 4, and 5 cases, etc. Vaccines work. Vaccines save lives. Please get the booster.
0	No no no no now I am not getting that damn jab
1	I’m all vaxxed up. Dose 1. Had a bit of a sore arm and slight fever that night. Next day all ok Dose 2. Lymph glands a bit swollen, a minor headache, and mild fever again next day. After that, just fine.
1	I want my dad to get vaccinated i dont want him to die:(
0	People have gone crazy with vaccines this is out of hand stop vaccinating!
0	Until the government forces the needle in my arm without my consent, I’m not volunteering myself for guinea pig  testing
0	Pffft, who needs a vaccine when you've got those flintstone vitamin gummies from 10 years ago.
0	I love this doctor for standing up and giving his professional and honest opinion.  We need more like him. People deserve to hear both sides and be able to make up their own minds. The “vaccine” should be a choice and only a choice.
1	People who aren’t vaccinated are the ones who are causing so many deaths
0	They forgot the 30% of healthcare workers, the first responders...and how many tens of thousands in all branches of the military. We won’t be bullied or forced into believing a rushed injection is somehow better then the immune system the Good Lord gave us.
0	The companies don't have to care about adverse reactions or deaths because they have no liability.
1	so glad i got the vaccine and a booster. i caught omnicron and i know it would’ve been worse n i could’ve given it to my mom
1	More risk die from not get the vaccine l have 3 vaccine.
0	I am that 1 in a million,so im not using that vacsine 🤯
0	No more jabs for me. Doesn’t work if you still get sick.
1	I am fully vaccinated and glad GOD led me in the right direction......Thank you to many and thousands of Scientists that work hard to do what GOD lead them to do
1	YES! The "side-effects" are a strong indication that your immune system is responding strongly to the vaccine. THAT is what you want! Your body is reacting to the supposed harmful "bug", the vaccine, and is ramping up the response.
1	Covid-Zero strategy is inane & doomed to fail with many inintended negative consequences. It is endemic in most countries now. get vaccinated and live normally. Lets get back to normal life please
1	This type of vaccine is new, but research and development on it has been underway for decades.
0	Crazy if you clowns take another vaccine in hopes it works on future strains. Gimme a break! The vax seems to be worthless. People running around saying it keeps you out of the hospital and lessens symptoms but those people probably were the ones Covid didn't affect too much anyway and probably would of been fine with your immune system. My brother in law works for the government and he sees all the data come in on his fellow employees and the ones who were vaccinated are the ones getting Covid and getting sick. He's unvaxxed but has to take a test constantly and they make him jump thru a million pain in the butt hoops for weekly testing. He says it's a nightmare but it's not the employees like him getting sick. It's all the vaxxed!
0	Why is the vaccine being forced on people?
0	Thank you for making this video.  I am sharing to my Facebook page in order to help convince people who are skeptical of the vaccine.
0	"Who paid the single largest criminal fine in history?" Google for the answer. There is a reason to doubt Corporations and Government agenices, when they work hand in hand to help one another.
1	I love how everyone is so fixated on the long term effects of the vaccine, when they don't even consider the long term effects of being infected with covid.
0	The longer I go without getting the Jab, the more confident I become that it was the correct decision.
1	the vaccine has saved lives. It’s been the lesser of two evils for many people. For other people natural exposure is a better option. There is no all encompassing answer. Each person is different. Some people wouldn’t survive Covid without the vaccine. That’s a fact.
1	Absolutely great news. Hopefully those more at risk can be vaccinated by January
0	Rather not roll the dice with my health, for everyone one else out there.
0	I hear the vaccine gives you penis spiders with perfect 5G LTE reception.
0	No. I hate waxine. It causes autism (I'm vaccinated and not a Karen pls don't kill me)
1	Great! Everyone needs to take shots!! That is the real way to rid it from all countries as per science and I believe their work much smarter than most people! Trust the scientists!!!
0	How patronising is this!!! He talks about the 'slight risk' of adverse reactions - over 1000 people in the UK alone have DIED from the vaccines so far. 4,200 in the USA. Thousands have had serious reactions. Any other vaccines would have been withdrawn if they had a tenth of that kind of death rate, but not this one.  To suggest that 'adverse reactions' might include 'my cat was sick' is just plain insulting.  I know of three people who have had serious adverse reactions from the vaccines - one person now has permanent vertigo, one person had palpitations and had to have hospital treatment, and one person who had the Pfizer one lost all feeling in her arms and legs within 7 hours of having the injection, and is still paralysed from the neck down, two months later. She's just 20.  Don't tell me that people's 'concerns' are not justified.
1	People are like I caught a cold and didn't end up in the ICU! Obviously the vaccine has saved my life!
0	Appearantly people don't understand what POPULATION CONTROL is!!!
1	Good news!  #PfizerBioNTech vaccines arrived ... other vaccines like #Moderna and #AstraZeneca are also coming
0	“COVID CASES ARE VERY LOW RIGHT NOW” ALL THIS WILL STOP WHEN PEOPLE SAY NO TO VACCINE! 😡
1	The first second and third shots keep the people who took them alive and out of the hospital... Hospitals are now the "unvaccinated ward"
0	The mask & vaccine mandates are doing far more harm than good.
0	"Anti-vaccine misinformation" i.e. when a doctor tries to cite to scientific reasons why you should not get the vaccine.
0	No if you follow the guidline of doctor then covid 19 vaccine is not only the option for the recovery. use the vaccine if you are in acritical condition otherwise take a steam ,multivitamin food, hand senatizer,face always cover talking time , social distance ,stay home stay safe.
1	The misinformation and religiously fanatic fear of the vaccines and facts is a huge problem. People are being idiots and selfish and that is putting us all in greater danger. 🙄 These fools only use anectodal evidence which is not evidence at all. You CANNOT come to any conclusion without knowing ALL about ALL risk factors.
0	I understand when people get the vaccine and then say "oh it was fine I didn't have any side effects" but what scares me is that there could be side effects that don't appear until much later and we haven't had enough time to test that... I don't want to be a guinea pig
0	"Died suddenly" or "cardiac arrest" are terms you will be hearing a lot more in 2022, and it won't be caused by the virus, but the treatment.
1	Vaccinated twice and had a booster! Feeling great…hope it works on any new variants like omicron.
0	we don’t trust COVID-19 vaccines in general.
0	My body, my choice. Ain t nobody forcing me to get the stupid vaccine or kicking me out because I m not getting one. Isn t it what you libtards always say with the right to kill a baby? Aka aBorTiOn?
0	I don’t want my kid to become a test subject
1	I spent about 7 days in the ER due to Covid and I haven’t been vaccinated personally it’s changed my mind about getting it I’m nervous but it felt like I almost died from it and I’m only 26.
1	Tell that to the 6 vaccinated deaths in Australia yesterday.
1	Fine. don't get vaccines. But don't take up my resources when you get sick from something you could have prevented.
1	I will be getting it to promote herd immunity and protect those that cannot get the vaccine, and I would love to travel internationally again!
0	Funny how they find the cure for this covid crap in a very short period of time and yet all scientists, doctors or whatever you name them, they haven’t have had any cure for cancer.
1	have been on the fence...worried about long term effects. I scheduled my vaccine after watching this video...Thank you for explaining everything so well.
1	Ummm. As pro-vaccine as I am...your statement that its "not clear" if its someone's basic right to refuse a vaccine is troublesome. I understand how important immunizations are and I am up to date with all of mine, I know about all the science and how anti-vaccination movements have seen a rise in almost extinct diseases, HOWEVER, insinuating heavily that someone doesn't have a right to decide what is put in their body is very telling. YES, there are at risk populations who would benefit from everyone being vaccinated...but I AM part of that population and I STILL believe it is an individual's right to decide what they do with their body.
0	Covid vaccine has caused my 39 year old Daughter heart issues, she was perfectly healthy prior, it was required for her job or she wouldn’t have gotten it.
1	I can tell that you really wished that you had been vaccinated, and will now only tell bad stories about covid.
0	We so called anti vaxxers know the truth. You only sell propaganda. We see thru all of yours lies. The sad part is the others that buy into it are mostly brain dead.
1	all nhs workers have to be vaccinated for a number of reasons such as hepatitis before they can practice why is this different.
1	To the people who say "its only 94% effective". Would you not buy a lottery ticket if your chances of winning were 94%? Cmon now.
0	the vaccine is a scam
1	I got my first dose back in December and I couldn’t believe how many people I knew and worked with who told me that they wouldn’t be getting it because Facebook conspiracies. It boggles my mind.
0	Your vaccine is experimental many side effect.. God will judge you.
0	It's not a vaccine, it's an experimental medical trial in its final phase. This is dangerous disinformation which would get thrown out in a court of law. "Stay safe" yourself matey!
0	I don't want to get the vaccine because my friend who took it, experienced side effects and passed away.
0	Why get Vaccinated if we now know it doesnt stop the spread of the virus? I need to know the logic behind it, and if you still think it helps stop the spread are you living under a rock?
1	I got my vaccine today
0	Politicians all over the world pushing toxic COVID vaccines will not end up well. When politicians in Europe, America, Canada, and Japan have to admit that the COVID vaccine is a disaster, then they will take the initiative to start a war to avoid being held
0	My friend (or relative) told me not to get vaccinated
0	My husband's cousin is in the hospital after taking her first dose. Her limbs are now immobile as a result of taking the vaccine and her kidneys are starting to have problems. She's been in the hospital for weeks.
0	Whenever a nurse told me I had no choice and she wanted to force me to get a shot that told me everything I needed to know. Thanks to her I've never had a shot since
1	Yes. More vaccine equity. What a HUGE task WHO. You have my support and prayers.
1	Please everyone out there, GET A BOOSTER shot if you already gotten 2 shots of the Vaccine because this new Variant of Covid-19 called the Omicron is becoming a concern.
0	How quick did they make that vaccine??? Think about that.....
1	The MRNA vaccines especially are proving to be one of the most important breakthroughs of the century. I'm really excited to see how they go.
0	Joe Rogan the vaccine doesn’t do anything you can still pass it and get it even tho you get a. They want people to get it for another reason I think
0	I will not take it. Will lose my job if I have to. Not worried about covid at all. Completely worried about government
0	They’re welcome to their vaccine induced immunity deficiency syndrome.
0	My daughter and her husband are both hard working RN’S on the Covid ward….MOST of the patients they get have had the 2 shots AND the booster AND are getting Blood Clots! I hear it all! They are so depressed!
0	Something that is safe shouldn’t be mandatory. Wakeup people
0	It is none of anyone else’s business if I have been vaccinated or not
1	Even worse, they are willingly exposing their children to the diseases.
1	I got Covid, was down for 2 months, recovered well. No long term effects. Loving life.
1	vaccines are like seat belts, they don't stop you from getting in a car accident, but if you do it will be much less severe.  there even a child can understand that...
1	Unfortunately there are too many anti vaxxers so i doubt the whole world can be vaccinated
0	Your immune system does that without making corporations very rich
1	I was nervous about getting the vaccine at first, but my children encouraged me to do it.  I got it and had no symptoms at all except a slight sore arm on the first one.    I'm so glad that I got the vaccine. If I can do my part to stop the spread of this horrible disease then it is worth it in my eyes. Plus, what is the big deal of wearing a mask.  I dont mind wearing the mask at all.  I just want to do whatever it takes to stop the spread of this disease.
1	I’ve been vaccinated. My side effects were minimal (a sore arm and mild flu like symptoms for a couple of days). My sense of increased personal and family safety greatly outweighs those symptoms. Here’s how I made my decision.  I chose to trust the medical professionals and scientists who did the research over the past couple of decades that allowed a vaccine to be developed. I chose to trust the medical professionals and scientists who created the vaccine. I chose to trust the medical professionals and scientists who ran multiple tests of various dosages of the vaccine to determine whether it was effective, whether it produced unacceptable side effects, etc. I chose to trust the medical professionals and scientists at the FDA and the CDC who analyzed all of the studies done before approving the vaccines for use on the public.  I chose not to trust paid political commentators who say, without evidence, that the vaccine is not safe just to generate angst, political gain, and personal wealth.
0	If they are so successful then why are the manufacturers trying to keep their data secret for decades?
1	Vaccines give you a better defence against a virus thus increasing your chances of survival. If vaccines were useless you would know a heck of a lot more people with polio
1	The science behind these new vaccines is so incredibly cool. What a time to be alive!
0	The covid pandemic is invented by the left!  The vaccines don't work!
0	im not giving my child ADHD
0	Unfortunately I have 2 friends fully vaccinated and boosted on ventilators and dying right now. So getting vaccinated did nothing for them.

1	To all those who wanted to “wait a year” to see how the #CovidVaccine affected others - this is your friendly reminder that it’s been a year now. Please #GetVaccinated if you haven’t yet!
0	How much you want to bet that if people stopped getting these shots covid would go away pretty quick.
0	Injuring children to make adults feel safe is a disgusting new Low for humanity.
1	Willing to completely trust modern medicine and doctors and nurses to receive an organ transplant-one of the most invasive procedures ever-but unwilling to trust that same modern medicine and those same doctors & nurses who are requiring a vaccine?
1	Vaccine is like a fail safe if you haven’t had covid. You don’t run the risk of getting it bad as you give the body a head start. If you have had covid
0	There's a reason why a thousands and thousands of doctors and nurses refuse to take that crap
1	ANYONE who refuses to be vaccinated - and doesn't have a legitimate medical excuse - should be involuntarily quarantined.
0	Please help us. I had to care for a patient who died from taking this vaccine,  and now they are trying to force us to take it, we worked for over a year with no adequate ppe which we still do not have, and no compensation...please protect us.
0	Nobody's forcing you to listen to me. Not like getting vaccinated....
0	A lot of parents are going to find out what ZERO LIABILITY means the hard way unfortunately!
1	Well done. Thank you for the refresher on the importance of vaccinations.
1	Use the mask and the vaccine.
0	Denmark and Norway halted completely  Astra Zeneca vaccine. Norwegian official said that vaccine is more dangerous than covid itself, especially for the relatively young people. Other countries will take their example.
0	Don't want the HORRIFYING side effects.
0	Who would put this shot in their kids? Especially children that young? Pretty shameful
0	Pretty simple if people dont want to put something in there body then they shouldnt have to
1	I got vaccinated to keep every Albertan, every Canadian safe.
1	Well everyone needs to get vaccinated to stop the spread, that's the only solution to wiping out these variants, make it law, get vaccinated or go to jail lol
0	They weaken your immune system
0	Step 1 Get vaxxed. Step 2 Get boosted. Step 3 Catch Covid. Step 4 Go to step 1.
1	It’s a difficult debate. I have gotten vaccinated, all my loved ones have been vaccinated, I do think it’s a good idea to get a vaccine. God knows everyone is tired of the Pandemic. People should have a right to choose but at the same time, people should have a right to go to a restaurant, Doctors office, grocery store, gas station… where employees are not as likely to get them sick, meaning those who choose not to get a vaccine. If everyone, vaccinated and unvaccinated, did there part to avoid crowds, practice social distancing, wearing a mask and getting tested regularly, I think it would help get the Pandemic under control.
0	Got to love how they use the word Inoculation instead of vaccine because of the negative connotation associated with it.
1	Maybe this hoax is ending but I don't it. After Omicron will come AnotherCon.
0	It's so safe, so safe, so safe, that thousands of people are dead and tens of thousands have permanent injury.
1	Well the problem is that people tend to be egocentric rather than altruistic. There are always people who always lean onto what they believe in and the freedom to choose also adds up to it.
1	Praise God for His wisdom for scientists to develop vaccine.  First jab ðŸ’‰ done to beat ðŸ¤œ #COVID19
1	I trust in this, all vaccines have side effects, but we still take them
0	Will not be taking this jab, people need to realise it’s gonna be booster after booster it was never gonna stop at two jabs
1	Wouldn’t it be ironic if a majority of these anti-vaxxers, got Covid and died.
1	I literally got the vaccine 3 days ago and felt nothing but a sore arm
0	I feel so sorry for anyone tricked into taking part in this experiment
1	wait till the antivaxxer realized their phone have microchips
1	Yes very safe and effective in preventing hospitalization and death. most governments and scientists around the world have worked extensively to develop the vaccines
0	Saying something against government narrative could increase your chances of a heart attack #CovidVaccine #VaccineDeaths
1	I long for a society where we can all at least agree that science is one of the most amazing and important achievements of humanity. It is literally the reason human beings live so long these days. Science and medicine progress has given us prolonged life!
1	The vaccine started working again
1	I'm in a conference call in which two currently active meth addicts announced they "don't trust what's in the Covid-19 vaccine".
0	“Just to be clear” #God, #family, #country  I am a #Patriot I love America #Trump is one of the greatest #POTUS I will not get the #experimentalvaccine I believe in 2 genders only.  #government is #corrupt I support #1A,#2A #Trump2021 #T-Bone steak Cut of meat
0	NO WAY. NOT ME. NOT NOW, NOT EVER.
1	Got vaccinated for my immune compromised family members and my 99yr old mother
0	Ha.. yeah, the benefits, (profit) for them outweighs the risk of human lives.... Hmmm .
0	they should stop claiming the vax is 97% effective. It is 0% effective as does not protect you from getting virus and it is 0.183% effective to protect you from dying as this is how many people died in USA from covid 600K that died divided by 328 MLN people in USA. Hmm wow very effective? Nonsense
1	Proud to say my only grandma is fully vaccinated now..  Ready to celebrate her 89th birthday in two weeks!!! Thank you everyone making this happen.
1	mom got the second dose today! Hopefully i can get one soon
1	This is GREAT another another weapon in this heinous pandemic now we don't have to depend on just one vaccine. A third vaccine would be awesome and probably on the way.
0	Vaccine - You will all be dead within months
0	According to your theory all the unvaccinated staff will die of covid anyway and the vaccine IS killing people not to mention heart issues strokes clots. Imagine being vaccinated can STILL be really ill/die of covid AND have the risk of adverse effects!
0	Vaccination advocates don't seem to fully understand that. There is no such thing as risk-free. Everything has a risk, even water. And then they are bombarded with "risk free" which of course makes them suspicious.
1	check the difference compared to last year. The vaccines have worked. In terms of vaccine mandates, that’s unnecessary in my opinion but unfortunately some developed countries have a low vaccine uptake thanks to scare stories and misinformation.
0	I'm not getting vaccinated for something that has a survival rate of 98%.. LOL my Vitamins and supplements have kept me free from Covid for 2 Year's...now.. that Vaccine is not guaranteed 100% that u are safe from Covid.. bc my friend Dan got vaccinated and has had Covid 3 times..lol while I have not had it at all..bc I trust my vitamins to work for me..I just love how the news tries to make it seem like the problem is the unvaccinated.. maybe bc were not in fear of this..lol besides there's a lot of bad things inside those vaccines and I don't trust it...we all have that Right to decide what we all put inside our bodies..
1	point is that the risk of acquiring natural immunity is far higher than vaccine, even if nat immunity may be nominally more robust (although my house has contracted covid 3x in the last yr, and if we were unvaxd and had more severe symptoms, natural immunity would be pointless.
1	There are some jobs that should be mandatory vaccinations like healthcare workers and people who work at old folks home but mandatory vaccinations should not be needed for a job like bartending or just going to the store
1	please get vaxxed
1	PLEASE GET YOUR VACCINATION! We get vaccinated for other things like MMR, Tetnus, etc. This is the same thing. So please protect yourself, your family and others.
1	It shows the utter hypocrisy of those anti-vaxxers. Either they do not believe what they preach or they do not care about the other person's health
0	I also regret getting it, constant headaches each day since the first shot (8 days) and from day 7 I have ringing in the ears, like a high pitched sound. It's bad. I started reading about this and looks like there are a lot of cases similar to mine. I won't be getting the second shot
0	Only for the elderly.
1	After reading up some more, I feel encouraged to get the vaccine.
1	vaccine related injuries are rare cuz vaccines work.
0	it's a vaccine that doesn't stop infection nor transmission- awesome!
1	With anti-vaxxers there is no hope for the human race
0	The vaccine was not created to save people from the pandemic  The pandemic was created to get people vaccinated
0	If the recovery and survival rate for covid-19 is around 99%, why the need for a vaccine mandate? Do you , as a physician, believe vaccinations should be left to us a personal choice?
0	Should we turn children into guinea pigs (and cash cows for big pharma) to change their survival rate from 99.995% to 99.999%?
0	I don’t need to take the Vaccine, I recovered from Covid and I have antibodies. I don’t want to put something in me if I don’t need it. CDC just came out with a study recognition of natural immunity after having Covid.
0	Stop giving people covid with these experimental shots, my uncle died from this shot.
0	Magic, just need that booster until that booster is no longer enough. Hamster on a wheel
1	fine for those who have received the astrazeneca vaccine as up to 12 weeks has been clinically validated
0	My friends daughter was forced into getting it for work, and she now has to have a pacemaker due to heart attack as a direct result from clots. (This WAS a perfectly healthy 28 year old nurse who ran 5 miles every morning) My wife's friend was immune compromised, and decided to get it, went blind in one eye after the 1st shot, STILL went back for the 2nd, and went blind in the other eye. I've had very little people in my life get it.
1	Antivaxxer logic: The bridge across the river has a 0.01% chance of collapsing, so I’ll swim across instead of taking it
1	Yes, if not enough people get it then we will not have herd immunity, which is a negative outcome. It then becomes the responsibility of the governing body to put in place restrictions, like we’ve seen over the last year, to entice people to comply.
1	Vaccines are developed through research and science. And if these people are rejecting science, I don't think they should waste further public resources by getting treated at hospital, because medical advancement is science and they rejected them.
0	Not worth the risk. Let natural selection do its job. Only the strong will survive.
1	I had the Pfizer's Vaccine shot in April. Got the chills 12 hours after my first shot. Gave me hay fever for a day. Weeks later after the first dose, my second shot was good. I never had the COVID-19, but I think it's better to have hay fever from the vaccine than being vulnerable to the virus.
1	Got the Moderna booster last night, I was worried about the after-effects because Pfizer really kicked my ass for the second shot (I really should've gone to the hospital for that honestly), but honestly, I'm feeling great, a little groggy, but no headache, no joint pains, no heart inflammation, just a sore arm.
1	It keeps you out of the hospital which is good enough for me.
1	They forgot to tell you that the reasons why vaccines were developed during long period of time it was because they needed to be sure about the probability of side effects that can be only evaluated after some considerable time passing.
0	Because most corona vaccines rely on machine learning and caluculation by high performance computers - complex “imaginary number” analysis in their development phase. The technology is originated in nuclear development. The mathematical concept is originated in Babylonian numerology. That is the reason for me enough to doubt the scientific literacy of such developers. I know some vaccine does not adopt the equation. So if vaccine becomes duty, I will choose the ones without complex analysis.
0	My son started acting gay all of the sudden a few weeks ago.. He took the vaccine a few days before, and now he's all acting weird..
0	Who knows anyone whom Corona has really put in serious distress? Even a doctor told me off the record that Corona is just a normal flu. Those who are infected die from such a flu than from Corona.
1	Oh please. I have friends who are nurses and doctors - they, along with the rest of the world are sick and tired of these loud mouth people who preach anti vaccines.   I don’t feel sorry for the deceased. Keep up the good work to all of our medical personnel!
0	Polio, measles, smallpox, meningococcal those vaccines are good but definitely not getting the covid vaccine.
1	When it's your turn, take your COVID-19 vaccine!
1	People claim Christianity yet don't want to mask or get the vaccine. I think since Jesus suffered the horror of crucifixion to give us eternal life, the least I can do is mask & get the jab to help give my neighbor a longer life perhaps.
0	SHE’S A DAMN LIAR. I’M SICK OF LIARS 🤬 She just can’t tell it straight can she????????? That’s because over 75% of the employees with the CDC are NOT JABBED. WHAT’S THAT TELLING YOU
0	It still has a 99.7% survival rate without the jab. Make this make sense.
1	If this is accurate, do so. This vaccine is important to eradicate COVID-19. Please, it’s just a pinch and it doesn’t cause mental diseases
1	Nobody's died from the vaccine, no. Only covid.
0	I have not been vaccinated because it was developed so quickly. Vaccines usually take close to 10 years to develop. At the beginning they said 1 shot, now it's 3
1	We need to let anti-vaxers kill themselves.
1	People should have a choice in refusing what they are getting injected into their own bodies without fear of prejudce or persecution.
1	In general, you do not need to wear a mask in outdoor settings.
0	I can relate to the hesitancy, after I received my covid vaccine. Ispent the next few days hallucinating. That is not an experience I plan on repeting .
0	Dr James , the world on his shoulders with hope for so many and ability to articulate the correct information , I am glad the science is slowly picking up ground , go Dr John Campbell backing natural immunity is far superior and longer lasting than vacine
0	Everyone knows what a vaccine does. They are a history of preventing infection and/or transmission of a disease. The coronavirus "vaccine" is just as much a vaccine as Elizabeth "Pocahontas" Warren is a Native American.
1	Had both jabs Pfizer and no problem....would take it again if needed!
0	Two mice were having a beer in a bar. One asked the other ‘are you gonna get the Covid vaccine?’  The other one says ‘ heck no, they haven’t finished the testing on humans yet.’
0	I do not need to be vaccinated. I have trust on my immune system.
0	What do we truly know about this trial vaccine of poison absolutely nothing
1	Fuck people If you dont wear a mask indoors (especially in my store) fuck you If you dont wanna get vaccinated fuck you If you persuade others not to wear a mask or get vaccinated cuz you think its against your human rights a big FUCK YOU
0	Yeah when people start developing strange cancer in 10 years from the vaccine, don't say I didn't tell you all so
1	Sorry for the antivaxxer family’s loss, but it is very interesting to watch natural selection happening so quickly in real time.
0	God bless all the protestors. You are saving the world.
0	Yeah I got the original strain, spent every moment of it with my wife and infant child… they never got sick and I beat it in 48 hours, it’s all lies
1	i got my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine today, so did my sibling and step siblings who were old enough to get it lol 👩🦲🤌
1	Keep it up covid deniers & antivaxxers. Don't let the medical experts confuse you with facts & logic
1	Vaccinations will keep the majority of people out of the hospitals.  They are safe. Some will react to them as with anything. Some react to certain foods too. Is all good bad? I know I can still get COVID but  not scared because of the vaccinations
0	One of the side effects of the virus is being dead. I'd call that massive.
0	So now we are supposed to believe that artificial immunity (manmade vaccination) which is an attempt to mimic natural immunity, is more reliable than actual natural immunity?!? Yeah, right! Tell a lie long enough and people might believe it but guess what? It’s still a lie!
1	Need Novavax for school and colleges mandating vaccination .... hurry up make it happen for >16 yo
1	If the CDC can approve emergency use the FDA could approve it as well. That is the only one that I believe.
1	Americans aged 50 to 64 who are unvaccinated are 46 times more likely to end up in the hospital with Covid-19 than those who are vaccinated and boosted.
1	Considering that 95% of the deaths in the delta wave were unvaccinated, I'd say vaccines are working pretty well.
0	Thanks for speaking out against mandatory vaccines!
1	Just get the vaccine already will you!
0	I’m vaccinated- got Covid really bad. I don’t need a booster!!! I’m the only person in my family that got vaccinated and I had it worse then everyone who isn’t vaccinated. I was down for more then 2 weeks. They all bounced back within 4 days. It was horrible.
1	We need to take care of our body! Take vaccines
1	Vaccine is important to protect ourselves.
0	God made our Immune system perfect to counter or prevent any diseases as long we live healthy evryday we are not easily subject for any kind of diseased. keep our body healthy by eating healthy food and exercises our food is our medicine,and trusting God every day.
0	I’m vaccine hesitant because there’s no way its been properly vetted.
1	This is probably the best news in my life time
0	I’m willing to move schools for something I believe in too I would rather have COVID than the actual Vaccine
0	I think most have come to the realization that the vaccines don't work and there are better ways of managing symptoms. If you hold out the trend will shift away from bad medicine.
0	I remember getting the flu shot one year, and it made my arm sore temporarily and I didn't like that. So the next year, I decided to see if I could go without and see if I got sick or not that year. Well, I didn't get sick. I'm someone who doesn't really get sick especially when I take vitamins like ester-C. I actually take a whole lot of other things in addition to that, and the covid-19 virus hasn't gotten me sick yet despite being usually out 6 days of the week, so my thinking is that I don't need the vaccine to stay well, and I have a Facebook friend that has informed me about how people are dying from the vaccines, so I have decided to share no part in any of the vaccines for covid-19.
1	My grandson was 23 when he got covid he's a fitness person he was very ill for 3 weeks fortunately he recovered my 76 year old husband got it and had no symptoms it's a lottery. This was before the vaccine came out needless to say we are all vaccinated
1	How to reduce your chance of dying from Covid by 99%? Get vaccinated and a booster.
1	Tell me, how that natural immunity worked out for 900,000+ Americans who have died from COVID?
1	Yeees, soon I can see ice hockey agian
0	anti vax is a collective term thought of by politicians and governement paid off scientists and experts to give people who don't want the vaccine a bad name, and shame them as some sort of conspiracy figure, when infact we are more concerned about what is going in our bodies from an experimental drug with no long term studies done.
1	Is he against vacations; just the ones for covid, or just for omicron? it's a strange attitude for a doctor to have but, hey! We're all human.
0	Never trust those masons. All this is a hoax!
0	No 💉 injection for me nor my family (we must call it injection, because is not a vaccine, open your eyes 👀
1	When my COVID patient in the ICU was asked if she was vaccinated, she said through her oxygen mask, “No, but I think I want it now.” That’s now how this works, now you have to fight for your life and THEN wait another three months to get a vaccine that could’ve prevented you from getting sick.
0	very very very veru rare veeeeeeeeeery rare to get ''covid 19'' under the age of 70.
1	It’s sad and sometimes makes me angry that in a country like the US has such polarising views on vaccines because it’s soooo available to everyone there.  I’m in South East Asia where vaccines are so hard to get and we’ve been in a constant lockdown for many many months.  People here can’t even get it easily even if they beg for it.
0	A true vaccine prevents you getting the disease you are vaccinated against. The covid shot at best reduce severity of symptoms, but do not prevent disease spread
0	After Omicron there will be another booster I’m sure, than another, than another and so on.
0	It’s perfectly safe!!!!! Trust them blindly you should get it or you’re a bad person lol
1	The point of the vaccines is to keep people out of the hospitals. To lessen the load on the health care workers.
1	If you have a wife and kids and family you love - get vaccinated! You have much more to lose if you don't This has nothing to do with freedom. This has everything to do with fighting a virus that kills
1	I've been triple #vaccinated and I've never had #COVID Part of my measures to stay safe - it's called 'common sense'. Same as Yellow Fever #vaccination when I travelled to countries listed below. #Covid_19 #Booster
0	And if it's mandated? I still won't do the jab. I'll gladly go to prison for non compliance.
0	Doesn't stop transmission or infection. But it works? Keep telling yourself that if it makes you feel better, you fool
0	The mask don’t work. The vaccine don’t work. Repeat
1	they just don't get it. I'm absolutely pro vax and think the idea of mandates to be absolutely asinine and precisely why I'm posting here right now.
1	Whatever we call it, it substantially reduces the severity of the disease. Isn't that enough reason to get it? No? How about unburdening hospitals (and staff) so other people can get care for non-covid problems?
0	It's not about keeping us safe It's about control.
0	This vaccine is not tested enough to be safe!!
0	A lot of parents are going to find out what ZERO LIABILITY means the hard way unfortunately
0	Haven’t worn a mask throughout 2020 and nothing is going to change now! As for the vaccine, never happening. I love how big Pharma, big tech, and the government try to incrementally try to take away rights and freedoms, and nobody stands up for what is right?! Come on America!
0	I got my booster(Moderna) 2 weeks ago and i still suffer from pain in my left chest and fatigue. Before the booster i was superfit and had no infection for 5 years
0	Perfectly healthy, gets the jab and then dies! You are delusional if you think he died from something else
0	I lost my job a week ago because I chose to not get the vaccine.
1	My brother didn’t get the vaccine and he is dead, end of story!
0	Soo the vaccines don't work, and you are at risk of complications when you take them, but, take them anyway. Thanks for your expert opinion.
0	The miraculous human body is capable of creating its own vaccine for any virus🙏❤utube Andrew Norton webber miracle of distilled water, go to 40 minutes of video for info on how to aid the body to cure virus
1	Our kids just received their #CovidVaccine Syringetoday. Thanks to all the amazing nurses who made them feel comfortable
0	Unvaccinated have a 1/14 chance of hospitalization, BULLSHIT
0	We have to be told the side effects and long term risks before we get the jab.
0	The shot doesn’t stop getting or spreading covid so it’s not about public health.
1	Boost my baby ! Thanks Science !
0	NO vaccination. If you run a cost/benefit analysis on this one it’s a no brainer
0	I’m not letting fluid created by billionaires be injected in to me even though  the “science” backs it. Their motives for mandating it are very shady.
0	Why would any parents be okay with injecting this into their child? To me this is child abuse! A vaccine almost killed my son! All 3 of my children are unvaxxed and they're healthier then those who are fully vaccinated! That's a fact!
1	I'm done reading non sense. You can die of covid 19. Vaccine it is for me!
0	Very good job world criminal organization!
1	Can't wait to get fully vaccinated too. Thank you for sharing your experiences of getting the vaccine. I'd rather get minor side effects instead of getting severe COVID-19 infection.
1	I got both doses last year. For the first shot, my arm was just sore for a day. The second dose was a little bit unpleasant. Had a slight fever and runny nose for a day, but after that I was alright again. Till now I haven’t gotten sick, so that’s good! Stay safe everyone!
1	Please get vaccinated we are winners and we can beat this disease, but we all have to do our parts...vaccinate.
0	My body, my choice, I will not get vaccinated
0	I'm working on fighting the vaccines
1	COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective at helping prevent COVID-19 infection, severe illness, hospitalization and death. Get vaccinated as soon as you can.
0	We have the right to choose our way of life we don’t need others trying to convince us to take the vaccines.
0	Why It doesn't stop covid, stop symptoms or re open the world literally no reason to get the worthless vaccine
0	A state senator is trying to mandate the vaccine for kindergarten and up without exemptions starting next year. This is not called science. It's called an obsession.
0	You don't get immunity after these vaccines, even the manufacturers aren't making that claim
0	First BioNTech, then Oxford, we seem to be on a very good trajectory.
0	It's pretty common now. I just found out about a whole dinner table of vaccinated people who are now infected in my area.
1	First time in history that the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who haven't taken it.
1	Vaccination is our only solution
0	I would more likely stay safe by keeping up my personal hygiene, sleeping good and eating well, and do some sports. And use herbal ways to heal my body from covid, not vaccine
1	I really hope the mRNA vaccine scientists win the Nobel Prize. Never has a vaccine with such high efficacy been created so fast using RNA.
1	I want freedom, that's why I took the vaccine!
0	Wake up Australia. Its over. The vaccine is not working does not matter how many you get.
0	The answer is NO. You are finding fake news on internet very fake news.
0	If the vaccine doesn't prevent one from spreading or from contracting the virus neither does it free people from putting on face masks nor reduce social distances between individuals, I haven't any convincing reason why people should take it
1	only the thickest people listened to the anti-vaxxers. You can't help some people.
1	Vaccination will protect from corona infections. Let's hope so to get all population 7.9 billions vaccinated this year up to month of August.
1	I’m not into politics, but these comments are so fucking stupid. Lol all of you complaining about masks and vaccines are the ones getting sick 🤦♂️ and repeatedly.
1	Darwinism playing out
0	There is no need to vaccinate anyone with this dangerous, experimental drug. A citywide prevention program using ivermectin as prophylaxis for COVID-19 was implemented in Itajai, a southern city in Brazil in the state of Santa Catarina between July 2020 and December 2020. According to this comprehensive study, the regular use of ivermectin as a prophylactic agent was associated with significantly reduced COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and death rates. The ivermectin non-users were two times more likely to die of COVID-19 than ivermectin users in the overall population analysis. Politicians are deliberately murdering people by preventing them having easy access to Ivermectin. Why have law enforcement not charged any politician with premeditated murder?
1	I see so many unvaccinated antenatal clients and mothers of newborns one into my workplace. It’s sad, the misinformation/ fear campaign has really gotten to them.
1	Got second dose. Get vaccinated when you can, wear masks and stay safe.
0	I’m not getting it. PERIOD
1	I’m getting the Pfizer tomorrow just because of the FDA approval and Trump says to get it.
0	Vaccines are truly evil.
1	Me and my 14 year old Cousin got Sinovacs two doses and Moderna as Booster no side effect so far so fantastic.
0	legendary vaccine, doesnt even prevent you from getting covid again lol goated
1	I feel like so many of y’all on here have no idea how vaccines actually work 🤦🏼♀️Pfizer team here!
0	The FDA has to keep money going to the Pharmaceutical Companies even if it is through unnecessary vaccinations.
0	Hell if I get a shot just for the card. I haven't gotten any shot, and I'm still virus free.
1	despite being vaccinated, you should realistically expect that you might still have mild symptoms like a slight fever, runny nose, and some fatigue, but you should still comfortably know that the chances you need to be hospitalised remain low.
0	I had a bad reaction to my first Moderna vaccine . Doctors were not only unhelpful but could care less. I went through 6 weeks of physical therapy due to intense dizzy spells. Then said I should go ahead and get the second shot . No thanks.
1	Got my 2nd booster (4th shot) on Monday. And yes, I still wear a mask in public. Worked 50 years to get to retirement and not going to mess it up now
0	You should be worried after you take jab cuz it will end up.killing everyone within 3 years so if you think.its worth your life then go for it
1	Great video, very encouraging 👍🏻just got my second dose and it’s been totally fine so far….
0	The Covid vaccine is neither safe nor effective, anyone trusting the CDC and/or the FDA is an ignoramus. People need to trust their physicians
1	It's so sad to see how little people understand about vaccines
0	I’d rather suffer from covid than get GBS. People survive covid every day, but being paralyzed for life is terrible.
1	Believe whatever you need to believe so you get vaccinated.
1	vaxxed + got covid before my booster, felt like shit but knew i didn’t need to go to the hospital either so others who need it more, can.
1	How desperate people are to take the vaccine. Good to end this virus with vaccine.
1	No matter how you split the data the vaccine is effective
1	While I do have faith in the Covid vaccine, it’s disheartening to see that a comedian that gets high and talks about monkeys and aliens on his podcast is managing to undermine the entire medical industry. I hope the industry can find a way to gain back more faith from the general populous.
1	Important for the EU to follow Abdala and Soberana vaccines from Cuba, where the cases are 60 per day today, and very mild reactions have resulted from their use in 10 millions of Cubans, also the millions immunized in Iran, Vietnam, Nicaragua and Venezuela with these vaccines.
1	The vaccine protects you from the most severe elements of an active and still morphing disease. It reduces/eliminates hospitalizations & the need for respiratory support. The vaccine is your best protection against a COVID death. But, you be you and reject the science.
0	My county just reported its first omicron case.  The fellow who got it had the vaccination and the booster.  So, there’s that.  Also, regardless of people’s vaccination status, viruses will continue to mutate.  One cannot blame the nature of a virus on those who are not vaccinated.
0	I wonder if she would feel the same after watching Vaxxed ( Vaxxed 2)... I wonder if her thesis would be the same after seeing the families affected by the side effects of those who did get the vaccines. I comment this because she pointed out the saving of "one child" is enough reason...
0	Stay safe. Stay away from anyone pushing the jab!
1	The only remaining question is when can I get a dose? When can I assume the people I walk past in the street have had a dose?
0	The 'vaccine' doesn't work. #fact
0	So... they know vaccine doesn't work the way it's supposed to but give it to them anyway? Wow... They have lost their doggone minds...
1	Im glad im fully vaccinated
0	My friend got the vaccine and got very sick after. After seing that.. I'm not taking the risk. It seems pretty dangerous
1	Honestly, as someone with high functioning autism, I find it genuinely insulting that people think that vaccines cause autism. Like. Come on bro. You think I am who I am because i got the MMR ...I got that vaccine after being diagnosed. Your move
1	We have decades of vaccine research that shows that adverse effects almost always manifest themselves within 2 months of a vaccine. We now have people who are a year out from their vaccines. These are incredibly safe by any objective measure.
0	My immune system has let me down less times than the government. Guess who I'm siding with.
1	No I don’t believe they went along not to get fired. I am sure I am not the only person to not only loose friends, but family too. Some of your are in a cult that is proven to be deadly in many ways to our country. Our country wasn’t founded on just your rights, we the people, is ALL people. So quit looking at this as a problem you can escape from any responsibility. Because wether or not you know it your lies have killed people. We are all in this fight together, well when y’all have had enough of death, maybe you will join the fight to keep this airborn virus from having a host to mutate in.
0	Interesting. How long have we been flattening the curve and how many shots are we supposed to have now? And now they are “exploring a vaccine that would work well against all variants”. I am positive that in December of 2020 that was what we were all told the two shots were.
1	You know what? Screw you guys. I'm a proud anti vax father of 5 and my kids are happy and healthy. Edit: *father of 44. Edit: father of 3. Edit: father of 2. Edit: father of 1.
1	And of course the drooling, one toothed goobers will still refuse the vaccine. Love how those rabid righties always call themselves "patriots" or "Freedom Fighters." In reality everything is all about them, no social responsibility.
0	I am too scared to take a vaccine because of the side effects
0	🙏no vaccine
0	IT’S NOT SAFE. THEY WABT US DEAD!! WAKE UP YOU BLOODY FOOLS!!
1	I’m in the second tier/group after our wonderful health care workers. Patiently waiting to do my part.
1	It’s really funny how politicians know more than doctors lmao XD
0	So much drama about getting vaccine. Dr. Who?   Cares. What happened to my body my choice? With all the drama and push, makes me suspicious.
1	The fun thing about science is, belief is not required.
1	Here's what I think of anti-vaxxers: “If they would rather die, they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.”
1	I just want to let you know that this video helped me and other friends decide to take the vaccine. I was hesitant but after looking at all the phases, I felt like it was pretty safe to take. Thank you for this! Now I even have my booster
1	Got the Pfizer. First shot was nothing. Second shot made me the sickest I've ever been in my life. Two days of misery but after that, I felt fine. It's definitely worth it though.
1	Yes, it's definitely safe!
0	nope,i promise you God and wellness are Better.I’ve been doing qi gong for a long time and ancient chi arts for self healing and just mainly health and well being.Have never had a better medicine than my own , you must see the truth in faith and spirituality if you want health
0	Delayed side effects, which are detected in the course of long-term studies, do not occur with vaccinations. Of course, there can be side effects that also cause long-term damage, but these do not occur late. There is no doubt about this from a scientific point of view.
0	It’s a shame they lying about those stupid vaccines that don’t work because to many people keep getting the virus after getting the vaccines and dying and having health problems and blood clots
1	Ignorance isn't bliss, it's the kiss of death
1	Vaccines really do save lives.
0	it’s already been proven and masks don’t work lockdowns don’t work vaccines don’t work. Why do you continue to be a dead horse? Whoops…maybe the horse died of COVID??
0	You know how when we think of the Holocaust, and ask ourselves "how could people let this happen?" Yea, that's going to be our children and grand children asking the same question about us.
0	Well that's awesome!
0	I remember getting the flu shot one year, and it made my arm sore temporarily and I didn't like that. So the next year, I decided to see if I could go without and see if I got sick or not that year. Well, I didn't get sick. I'm someone who doesn't really get sick especially when I take vitamins like ester-C. I actually take a whole lot of other things in addition to that, and the covid-19 virus hasn't gotten me sick yet despite being usually out 6 days of the week, so my thinking is that I don't need the vaccine to stay well, and I have a Facebook friend that has
0	This is just B.S. The mRNA doesn’t work. Whatever happened to, my body my choice?
1	Their symptoms progressed quickly and they needed oxygen and had to be admitted. They are currently in the hospital right now. Praying that they recover and finally get vaccinated once they are better.
1	Anti-vaxxers: Exist            Eradicated Diseases: Hippity Hoppity your life is now my property
1	Honestly, even as a republican, shut the actual fuck up and just take the shot
1	All steps have been taken to ensure that vaccines are safe and effective for people ages 5 years and older.
1	Yes hooray my mom's booster dose is booked finally as well!
0	I'm legit allergic to vaccines. So thanks to the rest of yall for keeping us out of the cross fire.
0	I was a little scared about the vaccination.
1	I realize that every stupid people who downplayed the severity of that virus or refuse to wear the masks or to take the vaccine, died from COVID
0	Then why did Warren and Booker get Covid after being fully vaccinated and boosted. It doesn’t stop infections or spread. Look around at the numbers.
0	Stop pretending you have the right to make me do it for you.
0	Phizer talking with the FBI is concerning, it’s also concerning to see children being vaxxed.
1	This is disappointing. We need more vaccine requirements, not less.
0	True story - my daughter and I are the only members of my family unvaccinated. We are also the only ones that have not caught COVID that we are aware of.Several fully vaccinated and boosted family members have had it twice.
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is a miracle!
0	Where I live, they've fired healthy, unvaccinated nurses and doctors and let COVID POSITIVE, vaccinated ones work... how much sense does THAT make?
0	Agreed. I'm not personally vaccinated because I already had covid, and I'm not personally willing to take the vaccine and have a small chance of side effects. I feel good about my natural immunity but I made sure to encourage my parents and older inlaws to get vaccinated simply to reduce symptoms when they inevitably got covid. (They all did after vaxxed). The idea that the vaccine is a tracking device or whatever else is moronic, but the vaccine that isn't a vaccine fell flat on its face and now it's about control. I'm not anti-vax I'm anti mandate. I don't care what definitions Websters changes.
0	just as you don’t know the long term effects do you? If you do please tell everybody, and show them the studies, tell us exactly what all the possible side effects are, and guarantee that it is totally safe and effective. From what I’m seeing so far it isn’t, is it? People are still contracting COVID apparently in similar numbers whether they had the vax or not, as you don’t know this information, because it’s impossible to yet know, what gives you the right to bully others who would choose to excersize caution, into going along with your opinion of the situation?
1	I wish antivaxxers would watch this video honestly, I’m sure it’d change some of their minds.
0	They chose to interview a woman who doesn’t know what to even answer, to make antivaxer look ignorant. Try and talk to someone who can actually give you not only a correct answer but past and current evidences.
0	Mask,vaccine cannot save you only Jesus can save you and your family.call on his Name
1	I'll be one of the last to get it but I have 0 problems with that. That are many who needs it before me. I'm just excited we have a little light at the end of this long dark tunnel.
1	"There are two things that are infinite. Human stupidity and the universe and I'm not sure of the universe."-Albert Einstein.
1	Yes, of course I trust the COVID vaccine.
0	That vaccine protects no one!
1	Give me all the boosters. Can’t wait for Sputnik 10.0
0	Why should anyone have a jab that they don’t need and could kill them, or give them serious side effects?
1	its killing people even just 1 person dieing is unacceptable these is a global pandemic not the common cold. By not takeing that vaccine your putting everyone at risk not just yourself.
0	To hell with ur vaccine
0	We have no data on these mrna jabs whatsoever. Dr. R0bert Mal0ne, who created mrna, has been saying for decades and still says it, that mrna jabs should never EVER be used on humans as we don't know anything about them. Their side effects far outweigh any benefits. Open your eyes and do some research.
0	"Vaccines are safe"  so is Russian roulette until it isn't.
0	Natural immunity is still the best
0	if someone is neither 'immune to' nor 'vaccinated against' covid and are not properly and consistently wearing a good quality and sanitary face mask while completely following safety protocols, then they are consciously choosing to be a liability to others. yes, its their 'freedom of choice' their consequence of what becomes imprinted upon their soul as a result is, also theirs.
1	It scares me, I'd rather get the virus than get a rushed vaccine
1	I just got it today
0	Covid vaccines injuries according to CDC VAERS is now 650, 000.
1	Some people have a allergic reaction to vaccines, but it doesn't mean all vaccines are not save for all people. I am frutose intolerant, but I don't say fruits aren't healthy for people.
0	My dad, when he was telling me about this, said that some manufacturers are so confident that the Oxford vaccine will work and be good that they're already mass-producing it.
1	The vaccines do work. It is tremendously succesful.
1	Taking the vaccine is the best thing that a person can do in this period
1	I even got the HPV vax and I’ve been married for over 10 years. If there is a vax for something I want it.
1	This is great all health care workers should be vaccinated to help protect them as the are doing a fantastic job.
0	I refuse to get jabbed, and threatening me over my job won't help you!
0	Vax mandates are from the pit of Hell.
1	Vaccine mandates are only needed because anti-vaxxers exist. The bad thing isn't the mandates. The bad thing is what makes the mandates necessary.
1	Now that this is approved, I'm going to get it. If it's been given full approval I have no reason to believe it is any more or less dangerous than any other vaccine I've gotten.
1	5th booster on the way!
0	My 21 year old son was in the hospital for three days after his second Phizer vaccination
1	my explaination to the anti-vaxxers: well, the reason your kid ain't dead yet is because of herd immunity
1	I'm sorry for your loss, but you have no reason to apologize for feeling that way. I've said this when the Vaccine was first issued. I'll defend your right to not get Vaccinated, if you defend my right to a Hospital bed if needed.
0	When a company says their not liable for the harm their new product may cause. I’m not touching it.
1	This really shouldn’t be a question. The vaccine for Covid-19 was created by licensed medical scientists and doctors to numb the effects of the virus. REMINDER: This does NOT mean that the vaccine makes you immune to Covid-19 and it’s strains. You can still just as easily get it from a spreader if you are or are not vaccinated.  The job of a vaccine is to lessen the pain and sickness of a virus. This is also what the vaccine for Influenza does. The vaccine does not kill people.  About 8,000 people die every day in the United States alone. Because this number is so high, there’s bound to be a few natural deaths of people who were just vaccinated the same day. I can tell you that I, and my whole family was vaccinated and nothing has happened. The shot was even painless.  You should get vaccinated. It is extremely easy to do so, and you’re potentially saving thousands of lives. Not to mention, you’re saving hundreds of thousands of animals and pets that cannot choose to get the vaccine or not. Yes, Covid-19 effects animals, too. And, if you’re too incompetent to get the shot, imagine a golden retriever out in a field slowly dying from the Coronavirus. You could’ve caused that by not being vaccinated. Not everyone dies from it, but many do. You also cannot tell if you have it or not. Some people contract it and then it goes away and they’d never know they had it.  If people don’t choose to become vaccinated to eliminate this virus, it will become the next flu. If you offered a vaccine to the Flu a hundred years ago, think about how quickly they’d start using it. Please be smart and get a vaccine. You can easily find them at your local drugstore.
0	This is a perfect example of the banality of evil.
1	kid: mom i cant wait to grow up! anti vaxx mom: oh i don't think so kid
1	That’s great news, but before we administer this fully-researched, life saving medicine to our children, shouldn’t we first consult with our Facebook friend’s brother-in-law’s second cousin’s former little league coach?
0	my friend just died of the covid vaccine named ronnie in kentucky.
1	I wonder if people would be so anti-vax, anti-mask if this was Ebola or some other flesh-eating* virus?
1	They will come up with another one anyday to control the masses!!
0	URGENT! No more vaccination pass obtained with an infection! Olivier Véran announced this evening that it will be necessary to have received at least one dose of vaccine and an infection to obtain the vaccine pass. It's becoming more and more clear, Pfizer runs this country!
1	It is simple...get vaccinated and your chances of hospitalization and death greatly decrease.
0	And I still ain't avin the vaccine
1	The anti-vax crowd, I don't know how to reach them. But, I certainly get the desire to turn to shame and ridicule for this group.
1	the religious exemption nonsense for the vaccine is bad enough (your religious beliefs do not grant you the right to endanger other people’s lives) but TESTS???'
1	We should have nationwide vaccines mandate.
1	Vaccination will help break the cycle of frequent PCR testing, quarantining, isolation. Your kids will have their life back.
0	I'm a happy anti-vaxxer, the vaccine is more dangerous than covid it self
0	All of my vaxxed and boosted co-workers are going out sick with covid. It’s ridiculous... unvaxxed have to work extra and pick up extra shifts and job duties.
0	She was 3 months pregnant when she was forced to get the "vaccine" in order to keep her job. 1 week after she got the jab, she had a miscarriage. I will never take this poison.
1	Been 5 months since the vaccine -- no deaths in my family. :) I mean, the death rate of COVID might be only 1%, but I'm not stupid enough to refuse a vaccine which has a 0.001% (I'm being generous here) death rate.
0	My problem with the vax is long term effects of the shot.
1	Couldn't care less about the antivaxers, but I can't help but admire the care , dedication and commitment these front line worker's are showing, I really feel for the female nurse that was being interviewed, love your dedication sweetheart
0	You’d think the jabbed would start asking questions by now
1	I will never understand how people who have been vaccinated COMPULSORY FOR THEIR HEALTH since BABIES since 1980, how they got to this point where they now say that vaccine doesn't work for young people, if when you're a fucking BABY, you leave the maternity ward vaccinated. there is no such thing as a vaccine not protecting, stop talking shit, damn you, get the vaccine and go to elementary school again
1	here in my country we are waiting in line to get turn for vaccine because vaccines is not enough
0	@maliahana @TomFitton It’s because the vaxxed have actually become the super spreaders, but no one wants to hear the truth. Most of the vaxxed ppl I know are regretting getting it now!
1	Yes, tf COVID ain’t no regular flu. I have forgotten about the influenza vaccine for awhile. But the COVID vaccine is essential, idk how I would be affected by that virus without it.
0	Are there people who still honestly believe in the effectiveness of these vaccines?
1	I am one of those people, just got my shot this morning
1	Thanks for the Doctors & Scientists worthy of more than a Noble Prize. Saving Peoples Lives.
1	I had my first shot a few days ago. The only side effect I had was a mild headache and a slight tender arm. Only lasted a few hours.
0	They're hearing the COVID-19 vaccine was rushed, that it's still under Emergency Use Authorization so it's not fully licensed under the FDA
1	It’s just a vaccine tho it has nothing to do about politics
1	you guys have a responsibility to take the vaccine!!
0	am (sadly) austrian and I reached the point that all I want, is to leave this terrible country. There is no free mind anymore, you get looks for sayin that you dont agree with the vaccine and eventually even pushed out of groups. To be honest, my country was great I was happy here. Never thought that I need to flee from my own country to escape this madness. I hope my wife and I can make it to a better place.
1	The Unicef is obtaining the corona vaccines for the safety of every child by taking pains wherever available the covaxin. It's a big effort but not easy. With this vaccines herd immunity gained by society and it woúld be as of previous . If parents and children felt Happy the whole society would be safety. Thanks to UNICEF
1	its really hard to be sympathetic toward these people. covid never had to be this bad but people refused to wear masks and listen to experts and now they're paying for it.
0	By early August, there were 87 cases of TTS in Australia from 6.1 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Five of those people died.
0	90%? Doubt it, im sure thats relative risk...What's the absolute risk reduction?? Ill wait...
0	We wouldn’t want those bits to activate before they’re inside somebody
0	This is insane you never know what this vaccine will do in this bodies of those child’s in a few year but their parents are responsible good luck to them hope never regret it
1	Thanks for all the links/explanations. I have been countering myths and misinformation regarding SARS-CoV-2 on numerous channels. (It can be somewhat exhausting at times.) Your video will be of great use in that regard.
1	I am fully vaccinated and the peace of mind I feel is the opposite of the helplessness I felt for so long. Living with a fully vaccinated person as well. I'm very grateful.
0	Stop calling these vaccines because they are not. Wake me up when we get to the 'Megatron' level.
0	I personally don’t trust it because we will never know what will happen 5 years into the future. It could start another sickness, kill some people, have no effect at all in the future protect us in the future, we don’t really know. This goes for all medicine and vaccines not just the COVID-19 vaccine. But since it is fairly new I want to wait it out just to be safe, you know?
0	I’m glad to see a lot of people are willing to defend their rights as Americans instead of complying. If we comply, we might as well be like Venezuela.
0	yeah but now they force the vaccine for delta and we have omicron, and the next season we will have a new variant + new vaccines so = every season 2  shots forever?
1	Vaccines. Save. Lives.
1	They're exactly the people clogging up the hospitals because they're unvaccinated and wait until the 11th hour to seek professional treatment. What do you mean?
0	Why not ask people who had adverse reaction from jab if they regret taking it?
1	Just a reminder 1.) COVID vaccines are performing extremely well, and 2.) the continued rampage of the virus is almost ENTIRELY due to conservatives telling their marks a.) vaccines don't work or are Soros-microchip satanism or b.) their "freedom" demands they not get the shots
0	I'd feel a lot more comfortable if some long term testing had been carried out.
1	People on the internet are so easily brain-washed by some conspiracy theorist.
0	Didn’t a group of doctors just come out with a study that shows the shot does permanent damage to the immune system?
1	unvaccinated people caused insurance rates to go up by using medical facilities unnecessarily. If you don't believe in the vaccine then you shouldn't be going to the hospital for treatment once you catch it.
0	What parents need to know: it’s completely EVIL!!!!
0	The covid vaccine is a mendeloid scam!
0	We have never vaccinated ourselves out of a virus that has animal reserves. Why do you think min 30k die of the flu each year? Children will still get Covid but are at nil risk. Deal with it like the flu don't inject them with experimental vaccines that will never work!
0	mRNA vaccines are certainly looking pretty good at the moment
0	Inflammation of the heart, a recognized side effect of the covid vaccines, kids born with heart defect
0	Fuck Fauci and his bio engineering disguised as vaccination . Don't be a human guinea pig unless you choose to
1	Stay safe, get vaccinated!
0	My healthy immune system is running just fine thank you. Been attending to it with great love for almost 52 years now. My body my choice.
1	No, you won't die. You'll probably get a little soreness where the needle goes in. 2nd dose may give you some flu like symptoms, but those goes away after a day or two. Don't listen to people trying to scare you. They aren't doctors, and are just scaring people with anecdotes!
0	You have covid for the second time and you are fully vaccinated. Then how is getting the vaccine helping? So weird you are telling people to get vaccinated when you are proof it is not working! So strange...
0	50 years from now, the errors of today will be known.
1	People who refuse the vaccine should refuse to go to the hospital.
1	They always talk about debates but refuses to read medical studies….
0	It's strange that they used different demographics in the study ie only people who take flu shots (presumably: at risk/frail people) in the control vs general population in the vaccine group. Maybe that's why they find those surprising outcomes?
1	Every day the technologycal possibility given by mRNA vaccines amazes me.
0	There is something in that shot that they want us all to have inside our bodies
0	Covid vaccines are not working as preventive the way we think of vaccines in the past. Covid vaccines are said to make symptoms less severe. Such is a function of drugs, not vaccines. Are people being drugged then? Then boosters are expected every so often even as it is good business for big pharma. Should there be any reason for people to be hopeful about vaccines now and in the future?
1	Vaccine is absolutely  brilliant.
1	Happy and relieved to have the #PfizerBioNTech #Covidvaccine ‚Äì amazing work from all at @MHRAgovuk and @NHSuk
1	I do not feel responsible for anyone who chooses a different direction for themselves. So do not judge me. I am vaccinated and that's that.
0	There's reason why no one is spreading polio/small pox you fucking retard, yet Covid is tearing through everyone including the vaccinated.
1	This helps a ton in getting friends and family with vaccine hesidencie to get vaccinated.
0	She got moderna and she knew something was wrong. 2nd dose was horrific. Our next door neighbour 35 years old also got modern and 2 months later she had a Stoke 10 days in hospital. Something is not right at all.
0	Two people, my cousin wound up in the hospital, mid 40s, healthy weight, second jab put him down. My mother in law wound up in the ICU two weeks after second Pfizer jab, she now has heart issues that her new cardiologist insists couldn't possibly be from the vaccine.............despite her being extremely heart healthy her entire life, not obese and not hypertensive.
0	Its different this time. I'm with the antivaxxers!!!
0	I won’t be taking this vaccine! We are still taking a shot for the flu. The flu started in 1918. What makes this vaccine so scary is that it’s been made so quickly and all the safety side effects aren’t really known. Two months is not enough time to find out the side effects. I’m a Respiratory Therapist and this shot is scary!
0	If it weren't for the politicians, I'd be more obliged to get a vaccination. But their lies, incompetence and confusion as to why I'm being punished for not having a jab has gladly stopped me
0	What if your unvaxed and at home with Covid but feel fine? Your vaccines don’t work.
1	My worst nightmare when I was pregnant was getting covid and having to be separated from my baby after birth. I isolated completely for over a month before delivery and got vaccinated as soon as I could. HOW could you not do that if there is a risk of you not holding your newborn baby in your arms??? It’s truly mind boggling.
0	"Vax-only" is the worst fucking thing the US government could've possibly done, it's what condemned us to hell If I could go back in time and blow up the stocks of the vaccine from ever being created I would
0	We don't even know how this affects adults in the long run and now we're putting it in our kids.
0	I mean it is insufficient. It was a rushed vaccine under the Trump administration. You can't just make a vaccine kick out fast without cutting corners.
1	I'm going to be honest and frank here; sometimes you have to let people drown in their own foolishness and ignorance. If these patients still refuse to get vaccinated then hospitals ought refuse continue caring for them. Make them sign a waiver of their decision so there is no miss understanding. These folks are using up resources unnecessarily because of their ignorance and foolishness.
0	This is what was shown in the Pfizer study supposedly saying the vaccine was effective to get EUA approval. When other doctors looked at the all cause mortality (everyone who died of any cause), instead of COVID cases, more vaccinated people died.
0	People are dying from the vaccine and now you want to give it to children ,shameful.
0	I own a business, and meet hundreds of people every week.  Still waiting to meet someone who actually had bad symptoms from COVID.  Haven't met one yet. I've met a LOT of people who have had negative side effects form the vaccine, though.
0	The most obvious news story of the day: #Quebec's decision to delay the rollout of #COVID19vaccine booster shots contributed to our astronomically high death toll (still ongoing) this wave. Who could've predicted this? ALL OF US.
1	I wish I had a booster shot 😔
0	The companies don't have to care about adverse reactions or deaths because they have no liability.
1	It's been a year... the Vax is safe. Grow up. Anecdotes are not evidence.
1	Vaccines help reduce symptoms, lockdowns help slow the spread
1	Covid-19: in a video, Didier Raoult repeats that the vaccine is useless. Worse: he draws lunar parallels with Nazi totalitarianism, concentration camps... How long will we have to put up with this anti-science offensive?
1	And I had my concerns but after watching this video I feel safe to go for it.
0	Maybe the Vaccine is giving them Covid ?
1	Vaccines are safe, and save lives.
1	So Covid is ‘comparable to flu’, as Sajid Jabhead has confirmed. The people who have been saying this all along are the same people warning you off the ‘vaccine’ and it’s many ‘boosters’. Just saying
1	if your child isn't vaccinated, then you know you did your duty as a parent!!  It's your job to protect them from those that want to do harm to them. Even if that entity is your gov and greed is their motive.
0	Dont forget to mention all the lovely illness that comes free with the vaccine your under selling it ... a dose of Pericarditus Myacarditus maybe a Pulmonary Embolism oh hey dont forget strokes belzposey or even a dash of long covid...Enjoy
0	I would never take it
1	I'm fine with getting a third but I really wish they could get the approval for children to have the vaccine.
1	I want to take the vaccine so bad but I feel they will get offended somehow so I'll do it in secret.
1	80 to 90% of all COVID patients are people who are  unvaccinated
0	My issue here with vaccines is if someone is forcing me to put something in my body. That I don’t want. For me that’s unacceptable.
1	Intelligent people are vaccinated. Lucky are those who are already received their booster.
1	Congratulations to all the scientists for creating this novel vaccine, which will give life back great to Americans and people worldwide. Science again benefits and rescues humans.
1	I'm struggling to get through this. These anti-vaxxers make no sense and it makes my skin crawlllll.
0	We have the freedom to choose what is best for our own health.
1	So as long as large numbers of elderly people remain unvaxxed or have waned protection, Covid will continue to be a major burden. If we want Covid to be over, and to be able to get on with our lives, we need to get everyone vaccinated.
1	We are way past time to just start euthanizing the anti-vaxers and coronavirus deniers. They had their chance to be decent human beings and they squandered it.
1	It is extreamely selfish not getting vaccinated
1	Amazing that people can work in a medical environment and be opposed to vaccines. How did these idiots ever get through school or get employed in the first place?
0	what about mutations, particularly the Delta and Omicron variants? What if a mutation overpowers a vaccine? Does this mean we have to take another one or a booster ? Would it be safe ?
1	I was hospitalized with Covid before the vaccine was available.  I nearly died.  This was in March 2020.  As of today (Aug 2021) I'm still having breathing issues, fatigue, and heart issues.  I recently received a pacemaker implant.  As I sit and watch these folks refuse vaccinations, I just want to scream.   Covid is no joke.  They still don't know the long-term effects.  My life has changed dramatically since my illness and not for the better.
0	Causes heart issues. They don’t tell you that
1	Im losing braincells combatting the massive misinformation in facebook, specially those stupid 40year old moms on their phone that they barely know how it works in my country Philippines. They are literally 2 to 3 decades older than me and they barely use their "life wisdom" and brain, im a stupid who combats stupids..Thanks Doc! more info for me.
0	Only God all Mighty can help us. Not a vaccine
0	My God ! How many people have to die from vaccine for others to wake up !!!
0	We need Jesus not a vaccine
0	Parents should be free to choose if they want a chemical cocktail in their children!
0	they're using the vaccine passport and the nano machines in the vaccine to track us. disgusting
0	"Feeling slightly under the weather for a day or so" So kind of like Covid for most people? Thanks for the propaganda but no thanks
1	This! I can relate to that. Isn't it important to know side effects and know what to do with them? The vaccine is a safer option most of the times but side effects may happen with everyone
1	Pro vax, anti mandate
1	The risks ov COVID-19, including death, are far more serious than the rare instances of blood clots occurring after vaccination.
1	I’m 92 had my two jabs no side affects whatsoever, don’t be stupid get them and we will all stay safe,not the worst thing I have lived thru.
1	So then you’re ok with vaccines being developed and administered to the non-Neanderthals that want them, correct?
0	Yesss, well done to these brave people, standing up for their rights. What has science ever done for us anyway?! I'll continue to take my advice from Facebook and YouTube like these people. Vaccines...pah!!! I can't wait for smallpox, polio, Diphtheria and rubella to make a comeback. Keep on keeping on, you brave souls
0	Let's look at things logically here for a moment. Vaccines have always relied on a person's immune response to create protection if the person is exposed to what they are being vaccinated against. The vaccine doesn't provide the protection. The body's response to the vaccine provides the protection. If you don't agree with that we have much bigger problems.
0	Imagine a vaccine so safe you have to be threatened to take it, for a disease so deadly, you have to be tested to know if you have it
0	First time in history that the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who haven't taken it.
0	If you're young and healthy I see zero point in the vaccine. Vaccinated ones my age have had just as bad if not worse covid19 symptoms than me or my wife. My vaccinated friend is currently on steroids, antibiotics and an inhaler for a chest infection.
1	I am fully vaccinated and the peace of mind I feel is the opposite of the helplessness I felt for so long. Living with a fully vaccinated person as well. I'm very grateful.
0	Vaccine development is a long complex process often lasting 10 to 15 years involving public and private participation. So, how can all of a sudden, they be so sure about these current vaccines without those long term studies?
1	I was scared to get the vaccine. I am terrified of needles
1	If you don't want to deal with antivaxxers in real life then tell them you've just been vaccinated. If they're true believers they'll run away from because of shedding. It's a double purpose vaccine as it keeps away the virus and stupid.
1	All I can say is give me the shot. I could care less. Herd immunity helps decrease the number of variants on this virus. The more the merrier is so TRUE.
0	Governments and pharma at their best. While we struggle they cash in and we end up paying for it in the long run.
1	Full store shelves here in the heart of con. land calgary…full store shelves are not killing people Covid19 is - get VACCINATED safe lives!
0	Exactly… I’m sad that my own family and other people don’t even see how this vaccine is going to do something to their body.
1	Received my THIRD Pfizer COVID - 19 vaccine on Tuesday and I’m starting to feel fully back to normal again!
1	I got my safe and effective #BoosterDose
0	If I worked for someone who was willing to sack me for not taking this experimental jab. I would be off sick with stress until I found a new job.
0	They like to make us think we dont have a choice. We do.
1	If you are allergic to vaccine then please tell others to take vaccine
1	Anti-trans scaremonger Abigail Shrier is now spreading disinformation about the COVID vaccines to her audience. Anti-trans bigotry is a gateway to a world of extreme right-wing content and conspiracy theories.
0	Don’t get the jab
1	Even if I had to get the vaccine and a heart transplant. I wouldn’t want my kids to grow up sad because I decided I hated vaccines more than I loved them.
0	Lol, I would certainly not get vaccinated to see France! Ugh!
1	I see so many people scared to take a vaccine because they are worried it contains some kind of chip or worse
0	Im not vaccinated and had covid 2 summers ago and felt tired. I had barely any symptoms because im healthy. No need to get vaccinated.
0	My sister became magnetic after the vaccine. I would never take the vaccine!
1	I got my vaccine booster yesterday, and it works great!!!!
1	The disease is very severe. I'm experiencing it now. Anything that can make it easier is blessed.
1	All children should get vaccinated, just like the rest of us. That’s how we will eventually beat this virus.
1	I'm more than excited to get vaccinated!
1	Save lives, get vaccinated.
1	Amazing! Can't wait to get the lil ones vaccinated!
0	If vaccines are safe, the manufacturers should not be shielded from lawsuits.
1	I felt rough for a few days after the vaccine, but I'd take it all day long before having Covid. My friend who fell ill with Covid before he could get the vaccine is going through hell. In his words he's existing in between coughing.
0	What about all the people dying from vaccine Doc? All of you will be held liable.
0	I'm not worried about being chipped. I'm worried about taking a brand new fucking vaccine
0	yeah and? Of course I'm admitting it. Whats gonna happen to me? They gonna beg me real nice to get the jab. Pfft I still say no. As it said, nothing they do or say will change my mind.
0	Then what's the point of the vaccine it's ridiculous people that have the vaccine have been given false security so they've been going around spreading it all over the place it's not their fault since the government gave them this false security but now you can't use unvaxed people as scapegoats
0	iam not about to experiment on my self for the government
1	Someone lives with asthma successfully for forty years, then catches covid and dies, and anti-vaxxers want you to believe she died “with” covid, not “of” covid. It’s a garbage talking point to support a garbage position.
1	The vaccine is not experimental and it is part of a multi pronged strategy that is grounded in science
0	No thanks I choose not to take the vaccine I just simply don't trust it yet I'll give it another year or two of testing and I will go from there
0	I dont trust the vaccines because of all the side effects I’ve heard/read about
0	Natural infection is better than these vaccines.
0	Getting the antibodies from having COVID is also as effective…and natural. During the worst pandemic we had during the Spanish flu..natural immunity took over within two years…masks were their best protection.
1	All you can do is research to the best of your ability. Talk to people who have had the vaccine, find out if they have had suffered side effects, and, if they have, how severe? Find out about COVID-19, how safe would it be if you had this disease? Would you likely survive? Would your grandparents or elderly neighbour survive if they became affected through your giving them the Corona virus?  I had the first injection three weeks shot. Apart from a sore arm, I have had no ill effects. I am glad that I have had it, because I am now far less likely to die from Corona virus.
1	Great video, very encouraging. just got my second dose and it’s been totally fine so far….
1	So happy and proud to get my CovidVaccine!! Thanks to the lovely Thelma, a former midwife, and all the other health professionals - it was super well organised and I am grateful!
1	When you get no negative reports you should automatically suspect something is wrong.
1	And yet my friend has been in the hospital for the last month because he did not get the vaccine. His wife did not believe in vaccines.
0	I’ve heard of the vaccines messing up a lot of woman’s menstrual cycles. If it’s doing that to hormones then I don’t need that happening to me.
0	Why are we artificially introducing mRNA to change the way our cells express proteins? How do we know these proteins don’t have the potential to be malformed (prions)?
0	no mask, no vaccine, no problem
0	42 U.S. Code § 300aa–22 No vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.
1	There is no reliable test to determine if somone has been vaccinated but , a serum anti-SARS CoV2 antibody test will be positive in the overwhelming majority of people who have been either vaccinated or who have been infected with the virus, but there is no way to distinguish between these.
1	everyone's got an opinion all I want is to be safe and have a life back
1	Vaccinate yourself and your children
1	Don't antivaxxers and conspiracy nuts make you feel like a demigod living among savages?
0	No one needs these injections called "vaccines". Gov't parties have proved that the whole pandemic was a hoax from the start
0	It's so good to see that people are waking up to all this bullshit. It's reassuring to see so many people questioning more. I'm 21 weeks pregnant and left the care of my first midwife when she tried to pressure me to get vaccinated and started treating me differently when I refused because I trusted my natural immunity more than the pharmaceutical companies and didn't think I was at risk. Found a much better midwife that actually mentioned the increase of stillborns among vaccinated and isn't pressuring me to take the jab. Seems much more trustworthy. I also am pretty sure I had COVID at the start of January and it was not a big deal. The week long headache was the worst part but that might be because I didn't want to take anything for it. Now baby and I are doing just fine. So glad I knew better than to listen to the first midwife.
0	Never had any vacations in my life from childhood to this day
0	No I wouldn’t trust any vaccine. As I know who owns Big Pharma and funds them.
1	This was really very informative and we are getting our family vaccinated after watching this video . Also I would get vaccinated from private hospitals, lost faith on government processes.
1	I've had 2 doses of vaccine and not caught anything since....but the tin foil brigade don't hear the positives.
0	I too have noticed that the vaccinated people in my life are getting sick and the un-vaccinated are not getting sick. Why would I take a 'vaccine' that doesn't stop infection or transmission? What they are calling a vaccine is actually an mRNA therapy that supposedly lessens the severity of covid (lol).
1	“What are the main reasons to get a COVID-19 vaccine?”  There is just one. It may save my life. I think that is a pretty damn good reason, even if you may disagree.
0	When your vaccine is so safe and effective you need a monthly subscription for it to work.
0	The vaccine will kill you and thousands of deaths have been “hidden” by the government.
0	Training and certification so important before delivery this vaccines  safe prevention firstly priority !
0	If something is truly good for you, you won't be backed into a corner about it, with fear propaganda thrown in your face. You don't have to coerce, manipulate and pressure people to eat their fruits and vegetables.
0	There’s no guarantee that the vaccines are safe. There has not been enough time to evaluate long-term effects. There may not be any problems long-term, but it’s impossible to know that yet.
0	bro there’s proof of people getting shot and having heart attacks getting labeled as covid 19 i hope y’all know this virus is man made you rlly believe a bat started this tf
0	Unfortunately, people who take the vaccine aren’t gonna live very long.
0	When someone is out of shape, overly toxic, and generally unhealthy—vaccines are of no use. When someone is fit, clean, and generally healthy—vaccines are of no need.
1	This doctor needs to be fired. Should've brought in a doctor who isn't insane refusing vaccine to debate him so his lies about vaccine could be revealed. He's constantly backtracking whenever he's called out.
0	Imagine how many millions the government is making but they ain't behind bars
0	Disgusted by the conversation on #BBCBreakfast about NHS Staff. 15 minutes talking about the unvaccinated staff like they are a problem. @DrSarahJarvis suggesting we sack them after the winter to “save the NHS”.No mention of personal freedoms, informed consent or exemptions.
0	All credibility has been lost! The truth might salvage a little bit, but y'all need to decide what's more important, the truth or your job... Bcs one is going to ruin you for life!
1	It is really important that every one take it
1	Love this video, I do hope that we will be able to vaccinate a lot more people in poor countries too.
0	I am unvaccinated
1	I got my first dose and now i am waiting for the second one. I got a sore shoulder for like 2-3 days, other than that i was fine.
0	i had to laugh "overwhelming fact that the vaccine is safe"
1	Ain’t no party Glädjedödare like a vaccine party! Wooo Partying face two #Pfizer and boosted up by #Moderna . Is that a sticker for children? You bet it is
1	for the un-vaxxed who die, I feel badly for the children left behind either with one parent or both gone. The children's lives are catastrophically upended and changed for ever. Ok, yes, vaxxed folks can die also, but at least they took the important step that could have prevented the virus.
0	Which is more reprehensible? Allowing those who do not want the vaccine (sometimes for good reasons) to return to a normal life, or injecting a vaccine into people who come under duress and can therefore no longer give free and informed consent?
1	How many so-called "Right to Life" folks are refusing to wear a mask or get vaccinated?
1	Anti vaxxers have no concept of macro population.
1	This morning I tested positive for COVID-19. I feel fine, and will continue to work remotely this week, as per public health guidelines. Please go and get the vaccine and the booster dose.
0	Social engineering 101:  Step 1. Create a crisis  Step 2. Keep people in a constant state of anxiety about the created crisis  Step 3. Offer the people a solution to the anxiety in the direction you have engineered the herd to move towards
1	35 million doses administered in the U.S. so far. A third of the way to that 100-day goal!
0	There's no social responsibility/liability for vaccines harms so I'd suggest those enforcing the vaccines are selfish.
0	Those plastic partitions make me laugh, like they will stop the virus from traveling across the room, give me a break!
1	The science behind mRNA vaccines is not new. It’s decades old,
0	Mandating something absent of long term data is one hell of a risk to take. The odds of some unforeseen side effect years from now is miniscule. But if you've got it wrong, you're going to be wrong several billion times.
0	THESE ARE LIES! CDC SAID NATURAL IMMUNITY IS BEST! STOP SCARING PEOPLE WE ALL KNOW THIS IS FLU SEASON!
1	I love how people think it’s going to hurt them. Do these same people not realize the amount of toxic crap they put in and on their bodies each day, and here you have a centralized commitment by the global medical community to eradicate a sickness and people politicize it?
1	Already did. Most vaccines need boosters, this is nothing new.
0	We were promised our lives back after certain level of vaccination, and we are still very limited all around, after that level was achieved. I feel deceived and have no trust in what I am being told by mass media anymore.
0	I am never risking my DNA over some flu #COVIDhoax
1	Get vaccinated it'll save your life
0	do you actually get paid for fake news?
1	My beloved parents at their honeymoon in the late 70s in Isfahan! They have been shielding for the past 32 months but got #COVID19 They just had their 1st #sinopharm vaccine a week ago!
1	Get vaccinated. It doesn't take anything away from you, but it might save a life!
0	Well my wife got the vaccine and now has COVID.  I’ve been doing apitherapy (bee sting therapy) and taking care of her while she’s ill.  I’m testing negative the last week.
1	Vaccines and the experimental genetic therapy/covid-19 vaccine are so safe and effective pharmaceutical corporations need to be protected from civil and criminal liability.
0	Government: We want EVERYONE vaccinated. Also the Government: Ignores the side effects.
0	Last I checked vaccinated were spreading omicron at the same rate as unvaccinated. Only difference is severity of illness. Help me understand how the vaccine, which was developed for a completely different variant of Covid, will help prevent the spread and mutation today?
1	Anti-vax influencers need to be held accountable for all the deliberate lying & distortion of facts.
1	Yes. Get your vaccine. The quicker yall wake up and get it then the quicker this pandemic will be over.
1	Rona vaccine free here and loving every minute of it.
0	Vaccination is all about money, greed by those who pull the reins! They do NOT care about the children whatsoever! Wake up!
0	When is enough is enough
0	And the vax works! Spreads from one vaxed person to the next! Thus, needing another booster, in order to get it again and need another booster...
1	I signed up today to get a vaccine ASAP.
1	Thanks Doctor for the great video. I had been on the fence from all the negativity from family members for exactly the myths which you have answered in the video. Your video has put my back on track to trust in science and data rather than all the gossip and myth that is floating around.
1	I know 6 unvaccinated people dead of covid. None of my vaccinated friends have had a rough time with it. Congratulations on your luck. 900,000 people in the US are not that lucky.
1	If you can get vaccinated please do for those who suffer from any of those disorders.
0	75% of covid deaths actually died from something else.  So I'm not getting vaccinated at all, ever.
0	How about you make a video interviewing millions of vaccinated people who now regret it too.
1	You ARE less likely to get sick if vaccinated, you immune system is quicker at getting control over it before symptoms appear. But if you do feel symptoms, far less likely to be a severe illness. The unvaccinated are at risk anywhere. Though I do believe that natural infection provided some protection, it’s been debated. You can absolutely still pass the infection even if asymptomatic, however coughing sneezing, etc will expel a higher amount of viral organisms than just speaking.
1	You really can’t reason/use logic with an anti vaxxer. Most of them I’ve spoken to don’t know (in simple terms) how a vaccine works. Lmao
1	The major drug makers that have developed effective vaccines have clearly saved lives and deserve due credit
1	part of the reason to get vaccinated is to reduce the number of people getting ill enough to go to the hospital. Because many hospitals are at capacity from COVID patients. If all the resources are being used on COVID patients, then they don’t have those resources to use on people in the hospital for other reasons. So if someone has a heart attack or a kidney infection, the hospital can’t treat them either, because there’s no room and no resources. Most people in ICUs right now are unvaccinated COVID patients, because they get more sick than vaccinated patients. The point is to keep people out of the hospital, so other people can be treated too.
1	I believe vaccine very much
1	Seriously though, why can’t a person make their own choice about getting jabbed without ridicule?
0	Each of those symptoms attributed to long covid are the same as the symptoms for having the vaccine.
1	Can we just take a moment and think about how truly amazing it is that we seem to have 2+ effective vaccines in less than a year from initiation of development?
0	That's easy, they don't work at all. You get the vaccine and still get sick. Take ivermectin and you don't.
1	Bremen,KS people, get vaxxed because dying is no fun (roll #564 /comment tier: basic)
0	This is my body and i decide if i get shot or not, maybe in 20 years when we know all the after effects it can cause and what not.
1	The purpose of being vaccinated is to acquire an artificial immunity. You need immunity because you need to hold off an attack, not to prevent one
1	The spread of covid doesn’t stop because one is vaccinated. So the only life you will save is potentially is your own. So let’s stop lying about how the vaccine stops the spread and saves lives. On that note I do recommend getting vaccinated, but support the right to make your own choice on the issue.
1	Can i just say these vaccines are safe and effective. I have taken them
0	Ummm no the data doesn’t show that. It’s shows that people who GOT COVID are most protected
1	Less death and risk of long covid dramatically reduced with vaccine.
0	covid is a lie to jab you
0	Healthy kids didn't need the vaccines either
0	you can NOT mandate a "experimental" shot (so called vaccine)
1	go get your booster vaccine guys!!!
1	Just by leaving those who are anti-vaxers and anti-maskers alone, will by natural selection make America great again.
0	There is no emergency for the vaccine to the  children and infants, this is insane!
1	I believe in what the people who know about medicine say. If the people say we need to get vaccinated, we need to get the vaccine. If you do this, you don't have any problem to play here.
1	VACCINES ARE OUR PATH
0	What are the long term side affects, oh, wait no one knows
1	I love how when you present scientific evidence, people still don’t believe you and say you’re being paid for this and/or pushing an agenda. Believe your conspiracy theories all you want... I’m going to choose to not live in fear.
0	Wht abt the heart side-effects of mRNAs
1	Vaccines help, a lot, but they're not good enough to end the pandemic.
0	Just got covid confirmed 2 days ago. I dont want to take the vaccine and still wont even after this omicron. Wasnt bad at all for me how i thought. Not scared if i get it again even if it gets stronger my body is used to getting well.
1	MORONS EVERYWHERE!!! Soon people like these find their hard-earned freedom from masks and vaccines stuck to a ventilator or inside caskets.
0	Be safe people, get your pets vaccinated too!
0	Shocker, the pharma company with no liability wants to print more money.
1	I just got my booster shot of the COVID-19 vaccine. (I'm an essential caregiver for my brother who is in long-term care.) It was painless. Thank you to all the medical professionals who are helping to keep us safe.
1	Because, unlike politics these days, science actually works. It. Can be TESTED. Results can be MEASURED. And you know what , lives can be SAVED! Remember trust but verify… well it has been verified, so trust that if you are vaccinated, you will not die from the virus. And just as important if you happened to be exposed to it, the chances of spreading it to others is very low. So do not let superstition, politics or fear of needles dissuade you. Get the shot !!!
0	YOU DON'T NEED A FCUKING VACCINE
1	I'm glad we are getting the vaccine out.
1	Got my first vaccine(Pfizer) this past thursday, my arm was sore for 2 days, feeling good, hopefully we can end this nightmare (covid)
1	Most non-vaccinated people that I have spoken to always say “they’re afraid of the vaccine.”  My response to them is “I’m more afraid of Covid than the vaccine !”
1	The vaccine might not be perfect but it definitely helps! And the booster, more !
1	I’m vaccinated, so is my entire personals web of friends and family. It’s is sooo hard to feel bad for people who cling to a cult, and to forgo doctors and scientist advice against their own detriment…
0	People should be able to sue the vaccine companies if anything goes wrong. The fact that this is not the case should make people skeptical.
0	Look into their eyes…they have no soul. These are truly evil people. I hope you guys don’t give this stuff to your kids. May god show his wrath on these evil elites.
0	I read the vaccine gives ppl rage fits & hysteria?
1	Jaymar from Saint Johnsbury,VT , ill give you a hi-5 if you get vaxxed
1	We must force people to take the vaccine!! As a father of two, I am concerned deeply for my children. It should be mandatory that all Americans stay inside, all day! I recently went through divorce because my wife went out in the public. Please, Mr. President, my kids need it!
1	I am fully vaccinated and boosted, I do everything I can to make sure to protect my hospital and my fellow Canadians. I'm doing this because I love this country!!
1	We live in the age of MISINFORMATION, more people would rather believe some random post they saw a friend post on Facebook than listen to an actual scientist. Truly crazy times we live in
1	People are free to refuse the jab, but if they do that they shouldn't then complain when so-called vaccine passports block the from going places. Choices have consequences, as the antivaxxers have so energetically screamed at the vaccinated. They don't like it when those consequences affect THEM.
1	Most will take it once testing has assuaged fears
0	Well, if quite a few of your friends only had mild covid symptoms the second time around it's because they caught Delta the first time around and omicron the second. Nothing to do with having had the vaccine.
0	The answer is NATURAL REMEDIES. Which are far superior than anything the pharmaceutical companies can ever come up with. Highly effective and completely safe.
0	The dozens of ppl I know who had covid and are not vaccinated are doing great. Full blood work shows after two years still have very strong immunity!
0	Greta Thunberg promotes vaxxination and places it on the same emergency level as the climate emergency. This is in total harmony with the roadmap of #KlausSchwab, the Davos Nazi.
0	Neurological damage, brain fog, migraines, weakness, heart inflammation, soft tissue damage, DEATH
0	There’s almost no benefit in getting the vaccine if you are under 50 because the odds of dying from COVID-19 are around 0.03% — about the same odds of being struck by lightening
0	NOPE. Not getting it
1	The most vulnerable Americans will get what the least vulnerable deserve.
0	I'm so happy I didn't get the vaccine
1	Fire her if she refuses to get vaccinated!
1	Thanks to scientists, government & private sector, my mother got her COVID vaccine today.  No pain or fatigue. Just protection & peace of mind.
1	Science is amazing! So many emotions as I got the second dose. Proud to be fully vaccinated!
1	Mass vaccination will let us gradually get back to normal.
0	I recomend you look at the numbers in the uk of deaths from covid after vaccination, from start feb, to aug 8th 2021 the deaths of people vaccinated outnumber those not!!!! DONT BELIEVE ME LOOK YOURSELF
0	Don't believe in vaccines, vaccines are not suitable for covid-19 variants, use plant medicines only
0	cdc data shows how many died from covid alone. It's not millions. Far from it. Why didn't so many die? Good immune system. Nothing to do with luck
1	How would the drug companies making the vaccines make money if more people are dead? The vaccines are safe.
1	We can vaccine, but remember omicron came from Africa, with low vacc rates. The whole world needs vaccination or it will keep mutating.
1	It is just as good in preventing deaths.
0	Here in DRC,we don't like vaccination,we will not die whith covid19, Jesus Christ is protecting us from that
1	Getting Covid (especially more than once) is infinitely more dangerous than the vaccine. You really wanna take a chance on that? #GetVaccinated
1	A message to anti-vaxxers you are the minority. Everyone else thinks you are stupid
0	Whatever happened to “My body, my choice…”??? Shouldn’t that apply to those people who choose to get the vaccine or not??!
0	It appears from the literature that natural infection provides immunity
0	I've work through the whole thing, never even had a cold.  My IMMUNE SYSTEM WORKS!!
1	am i really meant to sympathise for a woman who won’t get vaccinated while working with vulnerable old people?
1	COVID-19 vaccine safety monitoring has been the most intense and comprehensive in U.S. history. Hundreds of millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines
0	If I have to wear a mask I am not getting a vaccine.
1	YES IM VERY SURE UR VACCINE IS GOOD AND THEN IS COMINE SOON THANK U
0	I have never been anti vaxx in my life........until now
0	Hahaha a few months ago if someone suggested we’d be having a 4th shot, it would be deleted from social media for misinformation
0	Vaccine does not give immunity
1	The choice is pretty obvious. Get the shots or get Covid19 and possibly die—alone and saying goodbye to your family via zoom. Easy. Get the shots.
0	Vax pandemic coming to a town near you! God bless our children!
0	Whilst we are grateful that the pharmaceutical's made the vaccines, the government funded and rolled it out, we're at the end of the line now. The public should get the choice to get boosters or not, without them being isolated from society
0	I'm good. My immune system is fine.
0	Complicity Theorist: A person who accepts, without question, government policy.
1	2 jabs are not enough but you need a booster .
1	That's exactly why you vaccinated and why we should vaccinate-to REDUCE RISK of transmission, especially for folks with chronic health issues. Point being to stay out of hospitals, off vents. Prayers for continued recovery.
0	Anti-Vaxxers have rights, what about pro-choice having their say, it is all the same rights as everyone else.
0	Were we not closer when there were no vaccines? Self deceit.
1	I don’t understand why they don’t trust the doctor when they tell people to get vaccinated, but they trust the exact same doctor to treat them for the illness they could have been vaccinated against.
0	You know, people don't always not get vaccinated because we don't trust it.
0	Do not take this, before doing your research and listen to the 10.000 doctors that are against it
0	Vaccines all work the same, an ambulance comes for you in the end
0	They are still lying if they say it's due to high vaccinations.
0	Its different this time. I'm with the antivaxxers!!!
1	Symptom-free since birth, also vaccinated, tetanus, polio, hepatitis and FSME 10 years ago.
1	Sign me up!!! Ill be first in line! Medical Miracle!
1	To antivaxxers: Say you are entitled and selfish and don't understand basic medical science without saying you are entitled and selfish and don't understand basic medical science
0	It's time to stand up for what we believe in and fight for our freedom. Where are all the freedom fighters. !?
0	Thanks, anti-vaxxers! America's #1 in deaths!
0	YOUR GOVERNMENT HATES YOU. YOUR GOVERNMENT WILL KILL YOU TO PROTECT ITS VACCINE EMPIRE. IT WILL CHEAT TO STEAL ELECTIONS. IT WILL SEND OUR TROOPS TO DIE TO PROTECT GERMANYS OIL. HATE IT BACK
1	If you aren't vaccinated why do you care? Mind your own business. 61% of Americans are fully vaccinated...so what? I am. Why do you care if I'm vaccinated? I don't care about you. Mind your own business. It doesn't concern you if others are vaccinated.
1	I got vaccinated. Nothing happened. Did not get magnetic, still only surveyed by Google and Facebook, no less freedom. Just no covid. More freedom. That was the point. Mission accomplished. Thank you, science and healthcare workers.
0	I find it odd that our government is extremely generous when it comes to vaccines, but not antibody tests.
1	Anyone that choses not to be vaccinated should be on a wait list for hospitalization.
0	That's brilliant that you're fine after #CovidVaccine. I've had seizures, blackouts, loss of balance, skin irritations, worsening eyesight, menstrual disruption, memory loss, coordination problems, excess tiredness ... Now waiting for MRI brain scan and blood tests.
0	I just got the pfizer vaccine today.. im starting to regret it
1	got my pfizer vaccine 2 days ago and my arm really hurt on the first day, but it's getting better. get ur vaccine yall and hope that this pandemic ends
1	I  received my first Pfizer shot about 60 hours ago.  NO fever; NO headache, NO lethargy.  The injection site in my arm began to hurt about 6 hours after I had the shot.  The pain was manageable without ibuprofen or aspirin.  By the second day the pain began to fade and late in the afternoon it just disappeared.  I worked out today and feel fine.  From what I've read the second shot probably won't go as easily.  However, at 70 years old I figure the reward far outweighs the risk.
0	Why are all those safe vaccines so liability exempt, if so safe?
0	“The vaccine should be tested on politicians first. If they survive, the vaccine is safe. If they don’t, then the country is safe.”
1	I know how you feel jimmy. I got my vaccinations and I got Covid on Christmas Eve. My wife was negative. So we had to stay home. We had everything packed ready to go to the family and then I got the call. It was a great Christmas though. Hope everyone had a great Christmas!
0	And yet, people with both shots and the booster are still getting it.
1	Maybe this will convince the science deniers to get vaccinated.
0	of course they say it is "safe".  there are billions of dollars to profit from it, even though kids are like at no risk from the virus
1	We have vaccination but the people don't want to follow the rules so the virus is still spreading
1	I never had any problems on all 3 times I was vaccinated. Just like flu shot.  Have a wonderful evening and get vaccinated!
1	Thank you for some sanity in this crazy world
1	Unvaccinated pregnant women have 4X the risk of perinatal death compared to vaccinated women. Over 98% of pregnant women in the ICU are unvaccinated. Get the COVID-19 vaccine — it protects both the mom and the developing baby.
1	My parents got the 2-shot vaccine, they're doing perfectly fine c: I'm getting the vaccine next week! Edit: I just got my first dose of the vaccine a few days ago! My arm was sore obviously, but I'm perfectly fine right now =) I'll update again once I get my second dose.
0	I dont. over 70% of people in the UK who are dying from COVID was vaccinated in September. its a fact  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1019992/Vaccine_surveillance_report_-_week_38.pdf Thats not made up. thats not some conspiracy. these are government findings .an ACTUAL government.  I'm very confused here: I thought the vaccine was supposed to prevent you from ending up in the hospital and dying even if you get sick? Soooo how are all these vaccinated people dying in the UK?  Most people claim its safe… yes its safe and effective FOR MOST PEOPLE but i know many people who got the shot and are experiences bad long term side effects. Blood clot.. heart attacks Strokes… paralysis.Theres no long term data. and we NEED long term data more than we need to save .01% of the population who already has health issues.,  and the MRNA. type vaccines can penetrate the blood brain barrier.. as well as causing heart issues and blood clots. One of the creators of those type of vaccines admitted that personally  I have no problem with previous vaccines e.g Flu. Smallpox, pnemonia and MMR,( as long as you dont take too many as a child at the same time- which can cause autism from the thimerasol- which is made form mercury - a poison which side effects are identical to autism) …  I am 100% against the COVID vaccine- and i am a man of science . why because the virus has a very high survival rate and there is no long term data for the vaccines.  its foolish to put something in your bodies without long term testing.  Theres the answer. deal with it.  Facebook and Twitter should be more to blame because they don't allow free discussion. When you violate the First Amendment just because you can get away with it because you're a private company all you do is draw criticism and all you do is doubt everything that the government s  ays whether they are right or wrong. The last thing a person should lose in a free Society is a right to speak their mind without being censored  Does anyone remember this?  it took them 15 years to recall that. Covid hasnt only been exposed to the public for under 2 years now. vaccines have only been around a year. Why is everyone surprised to hear when there has very bad side effects?  and its not rare. I repeat NOT rare.  UK Government admit that the vaccines have damaged the natural immune systems of the double jabbed.The British government has spilled the beans about that fact that once you get double jabbed, you will never again be able to acquire full natural immunity against Covid variants - or possibly any viruses So let’s watch the ‘real’ pandemic begin now!In its Week 42 “COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report,” the U.K. Health Security Agency admitted on page 23 that “N antibody levels appear to be lower in people who acquire infection following two doses of vaccination.” It goes on to explain that this antibody drop is basically permanent.What’s this mean?We know the vaccines do not stop infection or transmission of the virus (in fact, the report shows elsewhere that vaccinated adults are now being infected at much HIGHER rates than the unvaccinated).What the British are saying is they are now finding the vaccine interferes with your body’s innate ability after infection to produce antibodies against not just the spike protein but other pieces of the virus. Specifically, vaccinated people don’t seem to be producing antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein, the shell of the virus, which are a crucial part of the response in unvaccinated folks. In the long term, people who take the vaccine will be far more vulnerable to any mutations in the spike protein that might come along, even if they have already been infected and recovered once, or more than once.The unvaccinated, meanwhile, will procure lasting, if not permanent, immunity to all strains of the alleged virus after being infected with it naturally even just once.Read it for yourself.. Page 24.  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/.../Vaccine?fbclid=IwAR1TvX22UmCNE1SwGewiDO7uxfhVfaD9dokk_or-4fA_8gRvVx2whW19x-0 https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/.../Vaccine?fbclid=IwAR3OipRi6PNhjwtmlDehmRnUIPmZM4a6111dCVVTqLnHNAV9CxxiQsbV07s The vaccines dont work. its been proven! An ENTIRE cruise ship full of people who 100% were vaccinated( they had to in order to be on the cruise) and theye had a pretty big Covid outbreak  Theres concrete proof right there folks! They got the vaccine and STILL got Covid. Not making this up. So no only are they not 100% effective. they are full of side effects- something even the biggest pro-vaxxers admit- so why take it!?! Why risk getting the side effects ? This is all nothing more than 1 huge gene therapy experiment with billions of eager guinea pigs.
1	I’m happy I got vaccinated.
0	Yes well I just read a nurse got infected after the 1st dose..so..
0	With all this covid19 vaccines going around the world do you believe they will tell us when they've found the cureâ€
0	Oh look, we no longer respect your choice, despite all the people who are fully vaccinated and still contract covid-19
1	Omicron is mild for those who are vaccinated and boosted, so the message here is pretty clear.
0	"they decided to get the shot" because you are giving them no choice. Imagine trying to survive in New York with little income.
1	Imagine if parents in the 1950s acted like this polio would still be around.
0	Why are there no traditional Covid-19 vaccines? I admit I've been hesitant about the mRNA vaccines, but at the same time I really don't want to keep playing with fire. I think myself and a multitude of others would feel more comfortable taking a more "traditional" vaccine like the NovaVax or CoronaVac. It would for sure boost vaccination rates. The question is why are none being approved for use, but they are approved everywhere else in the world....
0	I know ppl who got their shots and then got Covid, question is: would they got Covid if they wouldnt got shots?
1	Please go out and spread the word... Of getting Vaccinated. Such exciting tech.
1	DO THE RIGHT THING GET THE VACCINE!!!!
1	Give a nurse a break. Get vaccinated   85% of hospitalized Covid patients are unvaccinated
1	Yet these people who don't want to be told what to do never complain about the millions of other laws telling them what they can't do - speed limits, other mandated vaccines, excess noise levels, letting your dogs run at large, etc etc etc etc
0	if u feel fine why take it lol
1	I was sitting on the fence up until now and I have decided to give it a go ahead. However I still don’t agree with coercion, the more the authorities coerce, the more people are likely to rebel against mandated vaccines
0	Big pharma also said that Thalidomid is safe
1	On the contrary, many, if not most, health care institutions require all their employees to get the flu vaccine as a condition of employment
0	I am a very healthy person, I had never been hospitalized and I was hesitant to get the vaccine but I travel a lot. I got the vaccine and I got horrible side effects. I am out of breath every time I workout. I regretted getting it.
1	Booster shots aren't a new thing. If it helps protect my mom and I from being in the hospital I have no problem with it.
1	Vaccines are working, shocking right?
1	What sucks is that some won't get it because they're doubting it or they're conspiracy theorists. Humans suck
0	still not taken the vaccine every one i know who has had there booster is now sick with omicron ...dont know if any one else has found the this also
0	I've had covid with no vaccination and i'm still here.A miserable few days but I'm still here. Don't get vaccinated
0	vaccine is a lot more dangerous than covid
1	I  received my first Pfizer shot about 60 hours ago.  NO fever; NO headache, NO lethargy.
0	Uh, no thanks! I will not get the vaccine
0	Stay away from this vaccin
1	I got vaxxed to protect myself.
1	I think parents should be charged with negligence in a court of law if their child gets sick and or dies from something that there was a vaccine for
0	My Dad had a heart attack right after second vaccine.
0	Yes. Children are dying and suffering serious debilitating injuries POST VACCINATION. The RISKS seriously outweigh the benefits.
0	I'm seeing un poked healthy people recover from Rona in 48 hours. Do not get poked unless your elderly or have health conditions,  you don't need it.... kids definitely not it's outrageous.
1	yes they should be fired if they don't want vaccination
0	My Mother's Myasthenia Gravis was in remission for 22 years until two weeks after taking the 2nd covid shot and BAM, back full force.
0	I miscarried after Astra Zeneca. If someone wants to explain to me how they are 100% sure that didn’t cause that I’m listening.
1	Got covid a year ago, woke up with a slight fever and stuffy nose that lasted 2 days (thought it was just a sinus infection) and only realized a week later when I lost my taste and smell it was covid. Just recently took care of my gf and roommate who both came down with the Delta variant of covid. Didn't even get sick and got tested twice while caring for them to be sure. So remind me why those of us who don't want the vaccine need to be forced to get it to make you happy
1	When facing pandemic, freedom must not be an excuse to reject vaccines. You have absolute right on your body, but you have no right to spoil others bodies
1	Moral of the story, get vaccinated
1	In the last 10 days, a few thousand protestors have occupied Ottawa, shut down services, and cost millions in city losses. In the same period, 1.5 million Canadians received a dose of the #COVID19 vaccine. A convoy won’t bring freedom from COVID; a vaccinated population will.
1	I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE ARE STUPID ENOUGH TO NOT GET THE VACCINE
1	Now that we’re vaccinated from the Trump virus, I wish they would come out with a vaccine against the ignorance of anti-vax and trump supporters.
1	i got a vaccine like 2-3 months ago and im fine.
1	The people who want the pandemic to end have done all they can to ensure that it will. Every sane person is vaxxed  scheduling their booster by now. We need actual leadership. Mask mandates. Vaccine requirement for air travel. This shit is just as bad as it was under Trump!'
0	Im in Canada just had Pfizer vaccine and now have a blood clot in my lungs
0	I will not currently get a Covid vaccination because I do not trust the new unproven mRNA vaccines. Thank you bastards for collapsing my answer. Progressive trash.
0	So I can still get Covid while vaxxed, spread it while vaxxed, and still have symptoms if vaxxed. Why do I need to get vaxxed again? This is when trolls jump on my message and say “the symptoms are less” “it’s mutating because of the unvaxxed.” Give me credible sources.
0	I'm sick of the deaths and sickness from vaccines. Wake up before it's too late.
0	Leave our health decisions to us. Period
1	Whatever your vaccine is, as long as it is approved by WHO and it is anti-covid, it is okay. I was given sinovac and will be receiving my second dose next month.
1	I appreciate you guys, He is okay thankfully double vaxxed so just quarantining at home. But fkn hell he sounds like shit. Will keep you guys posted
1	it controlled the people// and destroyed thousands if not tens of thousands of small businesses//and told the people we are in charge// the only reason they did not take it to the extreme that australia did ,, is the 2nd amendment
1	In Finland, when I got my booster last week they did aspirate. When I asked about it, they said they were advised to do so by the national health agency. For the very reasons mentioned in this channel. I have to admit I was happily surprised.
0	It's not even a vaccine, it's an experimental vaccine and human being are officially a lab Rats.
0	No it’s not. It’s a poison shot and everyone should stay away from. DONT TAKE THIS POISON!!!!
1	it's important for them to know they are still extremely well protected if they got Pfizer.
1	get your booster
1	To beat the pandemic here at home, we have to beat it everywhere. That’s why the U.S. is leading the world on vaccine donations. As of today, we’ve shipped 400 million vaccines to countries around the world — four times more free doses to the world than any other country.
1	First time I see people being more afraid of a cure than the actual virus.
1	"there's no actual evidence vaccines work" the guy who saved everyone with the polio vaccine: am I a joke to you
1	So glad that people are bravely speaking their minds about this. I work in healthcare and I've been fully vaccinated. I believe in the vaccine and have seen its benefits in my hospital. I CHOSE to have it because of many factors, and that choice was very important. Just because I believe in the vaccine, just because I have had it and am fine, it does not give me any right to push that on others. It doesn't give me any right to feel superior, or to mock people who make different choices. We should all be encouraged to do our bit, whether that's wearing a mask, getting vaccinated or regular testing etc etc. People MUST have the right to choose what is for them.
1	So would these anti-vaxxers also refuse a blood transfusion from vaccinated blood?
1	I am glad you are well. I got my vaccinations too. Been watching cruise line woes , History in the making
1	Vaxxed and boosted and have not had Covid
0	It is a nightmare! 99,8 ,% survival probability and still the people get in line to get jabbed.Now they try to force the opponents who do not believe in this pandemic scenario. Just search Ellen Brown"Another big bailout under cover of a Virus" all the rest is Propaganda! Or do you seriously believe the Government worldwide take care of our health? They do not mind about the quality of our daily food, full of gliphosate, pesticides ,nitrates and cancer causing substances.they allow every year tons of nuclear waste, they allow pouring chemical in our river and consents pollution of millions of cars every day, but they are worried because we have a 0,2% probability of death in case we get infected with Covid-19? Follow the money! Or read Fabio Vighi "Selffullying Prophecy"
0	If this technology has been studied for decades why so many people has side effects(including a lot of my friends)?and also why these vaccines appeared suddenly now and not in the past?
1	I had been fully vaccinated since September and will be getting my booster on Sunday and no I’m not dead or magnetic or whatever people will eat up on from social media. The vaccine is safe
0	Unvaxxed and proud!
1	I was literally praying "please let me get my shot by the end of May" ever since they started rolling out but I didn't think it would happen
1	Everything, literally every medicine can have side effects but if they are FDA approved, they are almost always safe with  vaccine and those side effects being rare.
0	Basically a really shit contraceptive pill!
0	I refuse to take it
0	Guess pfizer need more money. Next they will want to get it approved for your pets. Dogs, cats, horses etc.
1	I just want this to end this pandemic
0	Money is in control here
1	Vaccines eradicated smallpox and have nearly eradicated other diseases such as polio.
1	Unfortunately I managed to evade the plague for years but not anymore! After a few days of a hellish fever that felt like it was boiling my brain in its own juices I tested positive for covid. Thanks to the vaccine it just feels like the nastiest flu ever.
1	Global anti-vaccine messaging around the adenovirus vaccines means that more people will die and the pandemic will be prolonged.
1	People who aren’t vaccinating make me sick literally and metaphorically
0	I am currently watching various videos to get some more information on the COVID 19 vaccine and I've decided that I'm not getting it. For now I'm doing very well with masks and social distancing, so I'm pretty confident!
1	I didn’t expect to be as thrilled or emotional after receiving my first dose of the COVID_19  PfizerVaccine, but here I am
0	Exceedingly rare side effects has become very common now, I hear.
0	Vaccine isn't working
0	This is the world we live in now?? Medical staff are allowed to essentially murder people? wth...
1	It may not be harmless but the pill and aspirin have a higher risk than the vaccine
1	The vaccines are effective at preventing Covid in people who are breastfeeding
0	This is going to be a huge legal issue. How can an employer force you to put something in your body and you take 100% of the responsibility if you have negative side effects? A
0	Who exactly do the vaccines protect? I know my antibodies and natural immunity protects me, which is why I live my life normally without fear. Many vaxxed can't say the same bc it doesn't prevent covid
0	I would like to know why the ceo of Pfizer won’t be taking his own vaccines and why the doctors and consultants in their numbers are removed from their jobs for not wanting to take it . If this was all about the health and safety of the people , it is absolutely wrong and immoral for the health professionals to be removed from their jobs when they are providing great service. This was all about the shares the government and MPs had with Pfizer and moderna to increase their own pockets 💰
1	the most frustrating thing is that antibiotics cause more harm than vaccines, and yet no one is saying how bad they are
1	Lab scientists of these companies are the unsung heroes.
0	I agree their no need for vaccine
1	vaccines for every body who wants one !!! fantastic !!!!
1	I am ready for #AstraZeneca . Or #BioNTech. Or #Moderna. I will take ANY approved vaccine. Why? Because our own expâ€
0	Pfizer vaccine kills more people than it saves.
1	Everyone ages 18 years and older should get a booster dose of either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna (mRNA COVID-19 vaccines) at least 2 months after receiving the Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen (J&J/Janssen) vaccine in most situations.
0	Do the vaccines provide immunity? Only to the pharmaceutical companies.
1	It’s cool because when I had my 2nd dose I didn’t feel anything it really helped my immune system good
1	It is absolutely incredible how far we've come in science and medicine. We all owe a great deal of gratitude to the thousands of hard-working scientists and doctors who are helping us end this pandemic. So thankful.
0	If anyone "forces" anything on me, I will defend myself to my last dying breath.
1	The purpose of vaccination is to protect us from different pathogens, either bacterial or viral. Covid vaccine protects us from this contagious virus, which is causing this pandemic, killing millions of people throughout the world. Hence this vaccination is imperative for everyone and it does not have any adverse effect except in persons with cardiac diseases taking blood thinners like Warfarin.
1	Doctors: We have proof that vaccines are good , Anti Vax: Yes But actually no
0	Its gene therapy, not a vaccine
0	I don’t think about covid because I’m usually pretty safe around them. We disinfect the desks, use hand sanitizers, and masks.
0	What about the fact that they are discriminating, they only recognise a certain strain….the issue is that all other types of pathogens and cancers are left to grow unmonitored by our now natural immunity being dampened down.
1	Praise God you and your kids are in good health. America 🇺🇸, Please, I encourage you all to get vaccinate and booster up, wear a mask because this isn't a game, This is a real life disease factor and it will get worse before it's gets better. God Bless The Tonight Show from your biggest fan.
0	The obedient always think of themselves as virtuous rather than cowardly. - Robert Anton Wilson
1	got vaccinated today. Please go get your dose of vaccination. Together we can defeat Corona and come back to our normal lives.
1	You cannot. To be honest it has some risks. No more than other vaccines, but they are there.  BUT, I know COVID-19 is unsafe, and now with the Delta Varient being more virolent and easier to catch I know I have to decide which will more likely kill me, COVID-19 or the Vaccine?  Easy, the vaccine is far safer than the disease.
1	This group should get together with those who stormed the capital. They could make it into the Guiness record book: world's greatest gathering of certifiable blithering idiots.
0	NOOOO TO VACCIN!!!!!¡
1	Just got my 1st jab by Comirnaty Pfizer-BioNTech after fighting with my company because they forced me to be injected by Sinovac. Couldn't be happier today
0	Do they have any kind of studies that this is working? Or are they just doing it to try and up the antibodies in the people each time
0	I've had a consistent forceful heartbeat and daily bouts of irregular heartbeats since having my first Pfizer vaccine back in April last year. I'm still waiting to get an echocardiogram for further investigation after having my symptoms dismissed for many months as anxiety. Naturally, I regret having the vaccine.
0	So it seems we don’t have to depopulate the earth so long as the people are all signed up for a great scientific experiment on the human body. Got it. First step. mRNA vaccine.
1	Getting vaccinated is social responsibility, don't ask what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country. Watching him back peddle to retain his job is sad. I don't watch him anymore since he jumped platforms. He changed maggoty
0	It doesn't prevent anything and people have been hospitalized for severe side effects and some died. This shot is dangerous.
0	They created the virus, gave it time to enter the human psyche and arouse fear, they created the demand, and now they provide the supply of the vaccine everyone wants and will pay trillions.
0	Sitting here not worried because I refuse to get that poison put into my body.
0	The data shows that covid isn’t really a big deal… and far too little of an issue to force a vaccine on someone.
0	Get that COVID LIE OUT OF HERE!!!
1	All three vaccines are holding strong against COVID unlike not being vaccinated
0	If anyone "forces" anything on me, I will defend myself to my last dying breath.
0	If it becomes "mandatory", I'll just pay the nurse to shoot it in the sink and record that I had it. I'm never accepting this fraud.
0	I will not suffer from side effects, i will never take jabs.
0	Wonderful news, but I wonder what's with this site stating that the vaccine failed? Is it credible in any way? Or what do they mean?
1	Vaccines have been the success story of 2021 More bad news for the anti vaxxers.
1	We need a movement to eliminate speed limit mandates! Why should the government have the right to tell us how fast we can drive? It's about our freedom. The Marxist nanny state people claim speed limits save lives. However we know that following speed limits actually puts you more at risk of accidents because you're on the road longer so have more opportunity to get in a wreck compared to driving as fast as you can from point A to point B.
0	Stick your expetimental vax up the a** Unicef. You are part of the problem!
1	You never lost your freedom. Sorry protecting your friends and family is such an inconvenience to you
0	This is the actual "Operation Warp Speed". The current jabs were the only option to stop the WEF from shutting down the world and a billion deaths over a decade. But now that we know those are no longer effective, STOP injecting the poison.
1	Yeeeeeesssssssss
0	It was rushed and almost definitely not a good idea to take it. Thanks we knew this already.
0	the vaccine is the government way of controlling us state
0	NOW scientists say we need to wait to see the long term side effects?? Those who are unvaccinated have been saying that the whole time. Lol to anyone who fell for taking that jab!
1	Incredible video. Literally just turned me pro vaccine, 100% brother
1	Are you vaccinated? Prevention is better than cure. The greatest precaution you can take is to safeguard yourself by getting vaccinated. Get vaccinated and Be Safe.
0	Why a booster when it isn't deadly. It is highly contagious but not seriouscenough to warrant more boosters
0	How do you expain to your child in 20 years time you let them take part in a clinical trial and that's why they're now infertile?
0	'Should'... Nice pic of military there, testing out the products no doubt unbeknown to them as always. Just do it.. you've taken loads of others.. what's another.. you didn't know what was in x, y, z... you signed up for it.. do as you're told!! You're in the military.. it's what you signed up for.. you shouldnt have the right to refuse whatever you're told to take.... oh sorry... zoned out there for a minute. Oh good.. testing another jab on humans.. what number is that this year!?
1	I wish all these  anti vaccers were old enough to enjoy the spanish flu.
1	maybe if you got the first vaccine we wouldn't be encountering so many variations ya dumbasses
0	Side affects would’ve shown by two months of taking the medication
0	The governments are trying to get people to use themselves as guinea pigs for experimental vaccines for the collective good, at the expense of individual risk. It’s evil tyranny. My recommendation is run from it and don’t look back
0	The only shots I'm taking, are the alcoholic kind! Happy New Year to all!!
1	While COVID-19 vaccines were developed rapidly, all steps were taken to make sure they are safe and effective
1	You are playing a very dangerous game if you think you're better off not getting vaccinated.  Are people dying in their millions not incentive enough for any sane being to see reason?
0	Injecting this poison left me with bad back pain
0	Being experimental with no long term data! Thank you but its a hard pass for me!
1	hank you jimmy! I have been down with Covid the last 8 days and it has not been easy and can hope every body will wear their masks and get vaccinated!
0	Because it is not really needed, it doesn't work, it does have side effects and it is experimental regardless of FDA approval.
1	On behalf of all of us normal people, thanks for getting vaccinated.
0	If anyone who wanted the vaccine has gotten it, what difference does it make now?
0	There's no long term tests.. YOU taking the shots are the TEST.
0	It’s probably as safe as ingesting poisons and pollutants could ever be. Anybody with self-respect will decline that offer.
1	I got the jab(s) to protect the ones I love and to protect myself. A lot of people rely on me to be healthy and to be there for them. If I get sick or worse, I’ve let them down. I want this all to end but it won’t by turning back; we have to go through it and come out stronger.
0	There are better, safer options than the vaccine.  Natural immunity.  Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin.  The main problem now is the Delta variant, which the vaccine does not protect against. Uttar Pradesh is in India, the home of Delta!
1	You should not have the right to become a host to a potentially deadly virus and then infect others by exposing them to yourself in pubic spaces. If you don’t want the vaccination then take responsibility for your decision and self isolate..
0	The only reason im not getting the vaccine rn is because my grandma arm turned green and red like the whole arm for a week and im honestly scared of needles
0	This pro-vaccination propaganda is getting ridiculous. I will still not do it no matter what you say in the news.
0	This idiot thinks vaccines are good but with zero long term peer reviewed studies I can pass on these for obvious reasons.
1	The two major things that affect the spread of Covid. How dense the population is and how dense the population is
1	India silently on the job of giving the world a #CovidVaccine. Clinical trials in phase-2 in progress
0	Because some part of you knows that the media is lying? Because the pandemic is a hoax?
1	Vaccines are not meant to stop transmission, vaccines simply keep you from dying. What is so hard to understand?
1	I am a student, I am studying via Zoom since 3 months now! Pls get vaccinated ! Stop thinking that is not secure
0	It seems clear now that as COVID goes endemic, only variant-specific vaccines will be effective. I recently recovered from omicron after being double-vaxxed. I won t bother with any more shots unless there is evidence it is effective against whatever the current variant is.
0	Every single medical professional I know thinks this whole thing is overblown fucking nonsense at this point.
1	I'm gonna start my first vaccine this week
0	Can any of the shots prevent anything?
1	I have got two vaccines,and side effects only for three days(a bit tired).After that, everything is fine. I am a regular blood donors(28 donation), and have declared in the blood donation declaration form.There is no problems in my blood cells.
0	By the way the 5.66m is the correlative figure. We didn't have excess deaths till the roll out of the vaccine. What is causing that if it's not Covid?
0	These days, the data I trust is what I see in my personal life. I personally know 23 people who have tested positive in the last 3 weeks, 11 triple vaccinated, 7 unvaccinated, 5 doubled vaccinated.
0	I agree with these ladies. I don’t trust the CDC or the news. Thank you for standing up for what you believe in!
1	When the omicron booster comes out I want to Moderna version. They withstood the mutations much better.
0	it should be tessted more
1	The US has like a surplus of vaccines and are even giving people incentives to get vaccinated, meanwhile in my country people are are trying their hardest to get vaccinated cause of scarcity. What a world we live in.
1	Getting vaccinated is a must. But dont forget you are protected only by the proper face mask since many are still not vaccinated.
0	Do Not get the vaccine
1	If we use all the tools we have, we stand the best chance of getting our families, communities, schools and workplaces “back to normal” sooner
1	I hope COVID kills them all
0	Given Moderna's share price is down 70% in the past 3 months, they had to launch a new product whether its actually needed or not.
0	Child got the vaccine because they really wanted it, and the parent still wasn’t vaccinated,
1	Myocarditis is more common from getting Covid than from the vaccine. Including in children. So I don’t follow. Seems like the risk of the vaccine is lower than the risk of getting Covid
1	Once I choked on pizza, that's how I know nobody should eat pizza.
1	Got my second dose yesterday and I’m sore from it, but it’s definitely worth it to protect my grandparents
0	Please explain tiredness that doesn’t go away even months later after getting the vaccine. I didn’t get vaccinated to feel extremely fatigued the rest of my life
0	I'm vaccinated and got the booster plus I had covid!! I refuse to get anymore!!
0	What’s false information mean? You say it’s safe but that’s not proven.
0	They are making a new formula directed at Omicron because *news flash* they already knew the shots weren't effective against omicron, - whether it's your first shot .... or your 4th.
0	They treat people like children to control. They told you to be scared to keep their control.
1	Yes. Vaccines should be mandatory
0	Vaccines are extremely important when they are a vaccine not an experimental gene therapy which is this case. A lot of people having adverse side effects do not report because they are dealing with aftermath or grieving the lost family members.
0	Required reading for physicians,nurses, and parents. Educate our leaders on the poison vaccine we are being fed.
1	I'm really sick of all the vaccine skepticism that even happens in my own home. First of all, it's not just take  for yourself but for everyone else too, but also l, bro if the 1% had already been so out to get the vaccine, you can bet that it's generally quite safe and ifs not gonna turn you into an alien fish or whatever.
1	Please have all the anti-vaccine anti-mask freedom that you want, but please don’t go to the ICU when you get sick! Save the beds for people who actually need it!
1	The first time in my long vaccine life that I had a negative side effect. General body and joint pain, tiredness, dull headache, loss of smell, and heavy duty arm soreness with itching. All for two days. Liveable and definitely worth it.
1	Get the jab numpties
0	I won't get vaccinated because I have concerns over possible long term negative effects of this vaccine, which everyone knows didn't go through the normal vaccine testing period
0	I clad i never had any of the jabs , mother nature gave me a immune system for a reason.
0	I'd rather catch Covid 30 times than take a dose of vaccine every  few months that proved its not effective and furthermore potentially dangerous since it's not examined enough
0	You mean the Covid-19 vaccines that don't work?',
1	When we get the flu shot, we can still get it... The same goes for covid! This argument does not show the inefficiency of the vaccine at all!
1	I have my appointment scheduled to receive the Phizer booster!
0	The primary reason I hear is, ‘it's too new; it's experimental
0	There’s something fishy going on it seems, so many of these posts coming up recently.
0	Did you get both? Please avoid the 2nd one! I pray for your healing in Jesus Christ name.
1	I’m excited for mine!
1	Having your child vaccinated for COVID can help restore a more normal life
0	Because of the "spike protein" vax, many vaccinated people will be stuck with permanently suboptimal immune responses.
0	Umm you can't thats why so many people are saying hell no. What's it going to so to your body in 10 years or so???
1	im living in a country where we have shortage of vaccines coz everyone wants to have it  if you don't want it just give it to us.
1	Yes, where we go
1	Why wouldn t you get the vaccine? Even if your not at risk wouldn t you get it in case of coming into contact with at risk people and the vaccine could help them?
1	We already have wonder vaccines, and idiots still refuse to take them
0	That is illegal an insane , you cannot force people to take vaccines , our body , our choice , this is like forced Rape , Massive Lawsuits against this government.
1	Really a great video. Yet I would prefer you had no reason to make it… but in world where rational scientific approach is loosing ground I’m glad you did. Thanks
0	After all the real data has been coming out you have to have a death wish to take this thing.
1	If the deniers and downvoters could understand reality and get vaccinated, we could get back to normal and save a lot of lives.
0	So glad that I live somewhere that our kids don't have to wear mask and parents understand there is no need to vaccine their kids.
1	Thanks for presenting these vaccine trial results, Doc. We appreciate your hard work. Continue to keep well and safe. Hugs for all who need one.
1	Jabbers will be maimed or killed
0	So, how is it justifiable to force Americans to get this “vaccine” for a disease with a 99.7% survival rate when the data show 80% of Americans had it & survived it with “natural immunity,” which the CDC showed is “superior” to “vaccinated immunity”? It doesn't make sense!
1	vaxxed and voted 💅🏾
1	Not getting vaccinated is no different than someone not wearing a helmet or using their seat belt.
1	Why the Fu*k do you care? People that are vaxxed have a 97% better chance of surviving if they contract covid. The truckers need to get in there, take care of their business and leave.
0	Omicron is a gift from God. Its giving us Natural Immunity across the population, without the dangerous side effects of the jab.
1	Would you rahter to scientists that studied for several years or some tin-foil hatted fool?
1	You are a bad person if you do not take it
1	Its almost like vaccines work!
0	No, people do not have a moral responsibility to take an #experimentalvaccine and NO they aren't "so good" at protecting against death or serious illness for that matter.
0	I'm certainly glad most of those out there who have taken the vaccine are leftist libt@rds. Soon this site will be virtually void of all of you and your painful ignorance.
1	There are few anti-vaxxers on my wife's side of the family. There is no way to talk with them about being vaccinated. Their thinking is locked and they have multiple sources of information that reinforces their beliefs, none of which are scientific or medical.
1	FDA approved. Now go get your shot
0	you fell for it as it’s illegal to ask that you can easily sue them! Your life and health is more important than anything else I would say stay strong and if I were you I would not take anymore of this experimental jab.
1	Bless these people. Let's not be nasty. These are all people struggling to make the right decision for themselves under acutely stressful circumstances. Get vaccinated and stay safe
0	The Corona Virus vaccine has been chipped and is far more harmfull than Covid 19 which is less harmful than the common flu.
1	i got my covid vax yesterday! i have bever felt netter
1	I would take 10 rounds of vaccine if necessary
0	You can give your bullshit vaccinations to the people who want to take them
0	The companies don't have to care about adverse reactions or deaths because they have no liability.
1	I don't know anything about Rogan but I agree with President Trump about vaccines.  Everyone should get vaccinated as soon as possible if you want this thing to be over.
0	The vaccine is bullshit!
1	So I got vaccinated and boosted. I socially distance and wear a mask and guess what? I’m fine. I’ve never been infected. I’ve never been sick. I stick to all the rules and keep safe.
1	Everyone in my family is finally vaccinated today! Me, my friends, my family, we've all got the jab. Hope everyone else can too!
1	I was vaccine hesitant for awhile since I had covid 2 times and only got moderate symptoms but now with the rise of the delta and other variants I decided to get vaccinated and so far I am very happy with my choice and my ability to look past all this fake news crap about the vaccine!! Now I just gotta convince my dad! Wish me luck
1	Had both Pfizer shots. Barely noticeable symptoms. Glad I got vaccinated !
1	But the anti-vaxxers say 'insert made up figure here' have died through vaccinations
0	I guess 4 year olds can’t riot..This is disgusting to have them vacinated
0	Let us all take solace in knowing most of those who have taken the vaccine are leftist libt@rds. Soon the crime rates will drop significantly, there will be far less traffic, the stores less crowded, there will be less hate, and this site will be nearly void of all of their painful ignorance.
1	Finally vaccinated As per National Vaccination plan, i can say Our Made in India Covishield vaccines are safe.
1	We can do this together
0	That's why it was mild...because of the vaccines!! Try without them!!🙄🙄
0	A person who believes that a Pharma industry wants healthy ppl also believes that a weapon industry wants world peace.
1	And I am so grateful. My parents are both alive because of testing and vaccines.
1	I mean while I agree in getting the vaccine I don't agree with mandates. I found it funny how he tried to tell the lady oh ya get the vaccine so we can squash COVID. No that's not how this works. It won't squash it. It'll just reduce risk to the higher risk.
0	The government does not care about you
1	Received my first dose of the #CovidVaccine #PfizerBioNTech today. I feel very privileged &amp; lucky to have this to pâ€
0	The same way you blindly trust that all medications are safe; by 'experts’ telling you so. The 'experts’ in this case had much less time than the usual to form an informed opinion, so you can assume that their opinion is not very up to standard. Those are the facts. Make of them what you will.  I've been down with Covid-19 already, so I see no need to get artificially vaccinated. Natural is always better. Of course, governments are probably going to want to force everyone to get artificially vaccinated through the introduction of vaccination passports, and these will likely have to be updated annually (with yearly shots) as new variants emerge. Personally, I'll take my chances with ‘natural vaccination'; i.e. acquiring immunity by falling ill. The one time I had it, it felt only slightly more uncomfortable than a head cold and resolved in much less time; and after almost a year of good health, I seem to have become as immune to reinfection as if I had taken the vaccine; maybe more so.
0	As these vaccines are in the experimental phases we can't make such assessments. Heavily vaccinated countries show high rates of infection. The only observable effects of the vaccines is a dampened down hospitalisation rate. I think these figures have been manipulated by various agencies who benefit financially from the sale of these vaccines.
1	There have been nearly 300 deaths from Covid-19 in our county of 150k. I'll take whatever vaccine that's available when I'm eligible.
0	yes and did you know the Red Cross will not accept plasma donations from anyone vaccinated because they do NOT have any antibodies.... doesn't that defeat the purpose of the vaccine entirely????
1	Your very good video has taken away my fear of vaccination. got my first shot today. Thank you for your factual and good information!
1	I don’t. I don’t have to. The numbers just show that all vaccines are at least 100 times safer than not being vaccinated.  More than a billion people were vaccinated. Nearly 8 times the number who had CoVID. 3.5 million dead of the disease at most 5000 of the vaccine.  (5000 is an extreme overestimate overestimate.)  5 in a milllion is much better (smaller) odds than 2 in hundred.  I took my chances with the vaccine not the disease.
0	Trojan rubbers have a better % of safety.
1	VACCINES SAVE LIFES!!!!
0	Experimental new drug injections should not be mandated for anyone of any occupation.
1	I don't respect people who don't get vaccinated for no reason whatsoever and then cry because they get covid hard
1	Being vaccinated greatly reduces the chance of becoming infected, and if infected the course is much shorter for a vaccinated person. Mutations / variants can only occur in infected persons.
0	Notice how they never compare to people who've had it previously.
0	First of all, it is not a vaccine, it's a therapeutic. It doesn't eradicate or eliminate anything
1	I won't be taking anymore vaccines
0	I am double jabbed and looking back I truly regret getting it done, it's affected mine and many other women's cycle.
1	My condolences with all the family .i just. Lost my sis and dad 2 weeks apart in augest yes my sis didnt believe in the vaccine so didnt give it to dad so they lost there life to covid.please i want to tell the world get vaccinated it could save your life..
0	Truth is we don’t yet know the long-term cost of the vaccines on the human body.  There are worrying signs of inflammatory disease, the Pfizer / Moderna myocarditis in young people is already terrifying.  Don’t rush to get your kids jabbed, doing nothing might turn out safer. Ball’s in the air..
1	good for you for getting the vaccine and thank you for sharing your experience!! I can't wait to get mine and finally feel safe again
1	I will be one of the first in line to get mine! Get vaccinated people!
0	There are no benefits in getting vaccinated just more money for big pharma
1	South Korea is in the midst of a major Omicron new case surge, with 86% of its population 2-shot vaccinated, 54% boosted, and other mitigation efforts. Their suppression of severe disease outcomes to date is impressive
0	Since the start of pandemic. I never had any fever and flu even pre pandemic. Not until i had vaccinated with first dose of pfizer last week. The side effects took after 6 days from my vacvination. And its the worst ever. Im even thinking not getting my 2nd dose
1	please, antivaxxers, do not wake me up!
0	Omicron is the vaccine we failed to make.
1	I've had both vaccines and a booster. i suffer from asthma. caught covid and was fine. no symptoms including lack of taste. my taste was fin
0	Sniffy joe doesn't like stuffy noses.
1	Stop spreading misinformation. Vaccinated test positive for covid in fact most of the recent wave were vaccinated. Is that difficult to understand?
0	The main thing that pisses me off is how they are basically forcing vaccines and say its the only option and never even mention normal health or mitigating other risks
1	Get vaccinated
0	Invalid Argument From Authority on full display here. "I'm a doctor, therefore I'm right." Like everyone else on planet earth, this guy has no idea what's going to happen to people who have unwittingly participated in this medical experimen
0	CDC have admitted the vaccines don’t stop transmission. Let me explain it for you - everybody can get cov and everybody can spread it. Don’t feel bad for hating people for no reason . You’ve been conned is all'
0	I am a stroke survivor and I’m terrified for the vaccine, just hearing how many people developed blood cloth After taking the vaccine I don’t want to take that risk after what I’ve been through with this stroke that was caused by a blood Cloth, so sorry for this lady lost her life leaving behind her daughter
1	When the lady says it was personal, it convinced me the vaccine is safe!!
0	Does anyone else find it as bizarre as I do that so many people don’t even question why Bill Gates is the spokesperson for experimental vaccines?
1	Best news to day
1	Life is not proven to be safe. But we just keep pushing on. We have done so since the Dawn of time. Vaccines are here to help us
1	Moderna’s vax gave me body aches for 12 hours, but I’m glad to be vaccinated.
0	20-Year-Old Model Suffers ‘Mysterious’ Heart Attack, Has Both Legs Amputated After Covid Jab

1	I feel so free being fully vaccinated since 2 weeks ago.
0	Nurse is more afraid of vaccine than covid after working on covid patients..... what else do we need to hear really
0	No one should have a medical intervention to benefit others, the ethics of which are highly questionable, and if the intervention is experimental, it is against the Nuremburg code, UNESCO Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights
1	#GetTheVax and boosted when eligible. It's safer than what fake news recommends.
0	The ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous.
1	The third dose increases immunity, so after the fourth dose you are protected. Once 90% of the population has received the fifth dose, the restriction can be relaxed as the sixth dose stops the virus from spreading. I am calm and believe that the seventh dose will solve our problems and we have no reason to fear the eight dose. The clinical phase of the ninth dose confirms that the antibodies remain stable after the tenth dose. The eleventh dose guarantees that no new mutations will develop, so there is no longer any reason to criticize the idea of twelfth dose.
1	You DON’T get as SICK !!! That’s why you should be vaccinated !!! It’s YOU PEOPLE THAT ARE KEEPING THE VIRUS GOING !!! Life will NOT RETURN TO NORMAL UNTIL EVERYONE IS VACCINATED , so hope you like this type of LIFE !!! It will NEVER END !!!
0	Those that have taken the vaccine are all just part of a huge experiment. Thank you guinea pigs. Let’s see what happen in the next year.
0	Scientists will say it's safe because there's no skin inside the human body
1	Tamil Actor vivek died today because of Corona vaccine  Side effects : Cardiac arrest
0	I've had covid with no vaccination and i'm still here.A miserable few days but a stroll compared to the flu-real flu-which can be so awful that death feels like it would be a happy release.
1	Thumbs up if you’re not one of these nutty anti-vaxxers that flood the comments section.
1	Oh shizer I got ze phizer
1	I had the vaccine when I was pregnant and I was terrified. It I don’t regret it for a moment. All the risks with the vaccine are super rare. They will probably just have a day where they feel off but much better than what the virus could do
1	Do mRNA vaccines reduce the likelihood of death vs the unvaccinated? The answer is yes. Has mRNA vaccines been under development for over 20 years? Yes.
1	Because YOU Spread it to her REST Of us. I can’t stand you Tin foil hat Conspiracy theorist taking up the non left wing. You have the civil liberties to drink bleach because only you is affected. You do NOT have the right to threaten and spread disease to the rest of us. Man, like ungrateful liberals, you guys have it too easy and forgot how important vaccinations are
1	When a second booster becomes necessary I will get a J&J. I’ve had 2 Pfizers and a Moderna. It seems like each shot has a particular strength.
1	some of you guys are not smart and it shows. “how did he catch covid if he vaccinated” well if you knew have vaccines worked you won’t be askin such a stupid ass question. just cuz you get vaccinated don’t mean you not finna catch it it just means you not gonna have the severity
1	An unvaccinated person is 68 times more likely than a vaccinated person to die and an unvaccinated person Is 16 times more likely to be hospitalised than a vaccinated person. I think that’s telling us that the vaccine stops even more deaths than it stops hospitalisations in vaccinated people than in unvaccinated people.
1	Should you take the survival increasing, injected, immune system stimulant? #YES
1	As a pediatrician & mom, I want to personally thank you for using the Facebook platform to promote preventive medicine (vaccines), parental leave, and paternal involvement!!!!! I wish this altruistic and responsible use of social media was more widely adopted.
1	People keep saying approval was rushed. Take in account, the last pandemic was before we had modern ways of acquiring information and materials, along with the world"s data on the pandemic. It is possible to get things done much faster than decades ago.
1	Getting the vaccine is an act of altruism: You are not just protecting yourself, but also helping to protect society as a whole, especially those so are most vulnerable.
1	Its mind boggling to see how far we have come in terms of science, technology and medical field.
0	Taking part in a medical trial invalidates life insurance and other insurance based on life insurance .... so the vaxxed cant: drive, travel, operate machinery, hold positions of authority or responsibility, get a loan, own firearms, enter security buildings, hold security clearance, buy a house, sign legal papers, be voted into politics ..... as they lose capacity .....ooppps.
1	Every vaccination matters. The vaccine side effects are minor and temporary compared to potentially developing long covid
0	We've been lied to too much and now that me and all of my friends and family have had covid both vaxxed and non vaxxed with similar symptoms its obvious to me that it is nothing to worry about for me specifically. Also the flu was way worse and i never get that shot.
1	Getting my second does in a week! Thank God for these scientists they are truly heroes
1	I feel a little safer again myself and protect the people around me.
1	Wow! I’m fully a pro-vaxer yet still found I had believed one of the myths! It never sat well with me that I “knew” for a “fact” that vaccinated people can “still spread the virus” I’m so grateful for finally seeing perspective on this issue!
0	Can we stop this nonsense now!
0	You'll regret taking it in a couple of years when the side effects show up
0	I regret getting the Pfizer vaccine.  I now have shingles. Related to the vaccine? I don’t know and that’s scary.
1	NZ Delta hospitalisations, Vaxed 3, Unvaxed 257.Vaxed Kiwis 3.16 million. Unvaxed Kiwis 1.84 million including all children.Based on the above data, chances of hospitalisation with Delta is 147 times higher for the unvaccinated.(257/1.84) / (3/3.16) Please get vaccinated.
0	I feel sorry for all young people that have been vaccinated since it is now obvious from the Israel case that it's useless.. but the most important is that pharma and test makers made a lot of money...
0	It was never about your health, it’s about your compliance and how far they can push themselves on your lives.
0	Why aren't people allowed to know the side effects ????
0	I respect everybody’s opinion but ill pass on that vaccine thank you 💯
0	Gonna turn zombies
0	You shouldn’t have trusted the science or the liars in government so quickly. Funny because I have zero jabs including the flu ever. Zero sickness. You should be pissed because you are the one spreading it not me. Yet so many on this conversation are so proud. Why?
0	Vaccine-roulette.
1	Why would the government jeopardize their tax revenue by giving vaccines that will decrease your ability to work? I don’t trust the government but we still have to be rational.
1	If this really works as well as they say it will I will gladly take it. These people will be / are heroes, this could save so many lives and end this nightmare! We really need something like this to restore faith in humanity and rebuild our confidence. We can make it through anything if we work together. Thank you for all of your hard work to keep people safe!
1	I jumped on my chance to get the vaccine as soon as the opportunity presented itself. These people are so ungrateful for their chance to beat this.
0	I am sure your investors and share holders will want a new vaccine for every variant
0	Natural immunity always worked and always will, no need for useful ineffective vaccines and every single doctor knows this.
0	I ain’t taking that until I see what happens to others. It’s not even FDA approved and usually people freak out when that’s the case. Not this time? Yea, I’ll wait.
0	And they call us crazy for passing on this experimental drug!
1	Each stone has a name on it and represents 1 person that passed away due to COVID. It happened because the vaccines arrived too late to Argentina RIP. If you have the chance…don’t pussyfoot & get your shot. It will protect you, family & surrounding people #Covid_19 #vaccination
1	I am all for vaccination & have been vaccinated with Pyzer since December of 2020 but many are having more than mild side affects. One person that works with us is having increasing neurological side effects at this time & getting worst. Her MD’s unable to cope with it? There should be panels of experts looking into these cases to suppress the negativity that results from people witnessing these individuals suffering. Who will care for these individuals in the long run? Issues constant headaches & migraines, stuttering & now uncontrollable eye movement, fluttering constantly. Very sad to witness to a person that was very energetic & had no issues like she is presently afflicted with.
0	If COVID wasn’t advertised by the media I would never know that there was a “pandemic”.
1	Let's just hope people do the wise thing and get it rather than listen to celebrity anti-vaxxers.
0	One video I saw told how the blood that fake protein is around makes the blood rancid, like old stale blood.. i can tell them where they can stick that vaccine at, but I wouldn't be a lady.
0	Medical professionals should tell you that a vaccine has to be tested for a certain number of years before it is safe to take.  All the doctors and medical professionals who now have flip flopped and are telling people to just take the covid vacvine over and over are not practicing what they learned in medical school.  I will definitely not be taking it myself and I applaud these nurses for exercising their constitutional rights as American citizens!👍
0	My trust issues said no
1	Not being vaccinated is like starting life on hard mode.
1	They’re willing to undergo anything more unconventional and expensive rather than admitting that the vaccine works. Arrogance can be deadly.
0	Don’t get that freakin tainted non vaccine!
0	What if I told you that the government gave out the vaccine for free to keep the general public sick and afraid?
1	I am in his age range but I took it seriously because I had pre-existing conditions and Im immunodeficient. I did everything I could to prevent myself from getting Covid however I live with people that did not take the disease seriously so I got Covid recently. Because I got the vaccine Covid was not bad at all for me and I realize how lucky I am. I was literally able to just stay at home and rest and I got over it just fine. I am so happy that I didn’t wait or listen to propaganda or whatever people are listening to. I know for a fact had I not had the vaccine I would have died.
0	don't get it. I regret getting the first shot so much. haven't felt the same since
1	Experiencing side effects after getting vaccinated means the vaccine is working, and your immune system is responding as it should.
1	Let's see the long term data on these vaccines. Oh, that's right, there is no long term data.
0	No, but the people who take the vaccines do LIE... they Lie Down permanently.
1	I have no sympathy for anti-vaxers who die of covid.
1	Sorry to report that chances of myocarditis is infinitely higher with Covid than from the vaccine. And natural immunity has shown to wane during the Omicron surge with millions of reinfections. But keep listening to the crackpots and liars so you feel better about yourself
0	Lots of fascinating stuff in this, as I think it's the first attempt to analyse how long protection might last from these vaccines. 91.3% at six months is stupendous, obviously, with the number looking incredibly robust thanks to the sheer number of cases recorded in the trial now.
1	Glad I have my booster shot!
0	If an individual has an adverse effect or dies 13 days after their second vaccination, this is classified as an unvaccinated non-COVID death, and apparently many who die post vaccine, do so in this time period. So, would this not effect the entire data set? Also, the exclusion criteria in this study is death 30 days outside COVID illness or a SARS-Cov-2 test positivity. Would this also not effect the results regarding non-COVID
1	This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Protect yourself and others. Get VAXED!
1	Had my jab today. Time for us all to get on board. #PfizerBioNTech #covid19 @SwanseabayNHS
1	So yeah, I regret not getting the booster sooner. I didn't realize all the science behind it being so important for omicron until it was too late. I couldn't believe a vaccine i got 6 months ago was already useless!
0	If you were smart you would never get that vaccine... The data already proves that it's dangerous and it won't be long until they cannot continue to hide the facts
1	Because so far, nearly 100 million doses of vaccine have been given and there has been only one death which might, possibly, have been due to a bad reaction to the vaccine. One in 100 million is a lot less than the risk of dying from, say, eating a toffee.
1	She forgot that she is not a doctor. Actually I'd be surprised to see a doctor not wanting to get vaccinated.
1	So NOW what's your excuse people, roll up your sleeves and get vaccinated! Do it for you, your family, your friends and your neighborhood.
0	The vaccine mandate imposed by the Trudeau government on the trucking industry is unnecessary, and will surely have significant impacts on the household goods and products that Canadians rely on.
1	If only there had been something they could have done to stay alive… oh wait, THERE WAS. I feel sorry for their families, they lost a loved one because they were too stupid to save their own lives, but not for them. Their ignorance and selfishness clogged up the hospital system and deprived others who did the right thing of healthcare and put others at risk.
0	Just say NO to drugs, one vaccines, two vaccines, three vaccines, boosters, boosters boosters and more boosters! Say YES to God given natural immunity! It worked for me.
1	If you are not vaccinated please don't shop here. Bye!
0	I not get vaccin I am vegan stay safe keep wear mask it not over yet.
0	Dude I don't care if you get vaxxed or not but all you pro vaxxers wanna try and force me to get the jab which is what i'm against.
0	The human body provides complete immunization on it's own.
1	Ah yes I CAN NOT WAIT for anti vaxxers to reject the vaccine and then all die, at least it would take out the retards who believe in everything thing they hear from one guy or one side.
0	Wait! You didn't show how nurses that work the whole pandemic are losing their jobs because they refuse to take this mystery shot!
0	The fact that they’re trying THIS hard to convince people to get that shot should scare the hell out of all of you.
1	we are all in this together (and together is the only way we can defeat the virus with the vaccine).
0	Keep getting your boosters sheep!
0	Not vaxxed. COVID twice. Still kicking. I should have died 194 times by now.
0	Are you blind?! The pandemic is a hoax! They use lockdowns and vaccines to control us!!!
0	Taking the vaccine in exchange for the hope on an easier progression of the illness, is like cutting off your leg to avoid athletes foot!
1	just at a much lower ration than unvaccinated people and with much milder symptoms. A vaccinated person is in average 80% less likely to get infected by Covid-19, around 95% less likely to develop serious symptoms, and 97+ (depends on age) less likely to die with Covid.
1	Vaccinations save life and takes us out of this pandemic
1	Causing a panic over the safety of the COVID vaccine sure seems like shouting fire in the theater to me.
0	Israel is overrun with Covid. The vaccines have failed. The experiment must stop.I had both vaccines"
1	THE COVID19 VACCINE IS IMPORTANT FOR ANYBODY.
0	I understand when people get the vaccine and then say "oh it was fine I didn't have any side effects" but what scares me is that there could be side effects that don't appear until much later and we haven't had enough time to test that... I don't want to be a guinea pig
1	Some of the anti-vax people I know have put far, far more dangerous and sketchy things in their body but self awareness isn't the strong suit
1	Need to hurry this up
1	I took the booster dose today .
1	For Jumpstar: Exact quote from the Oregonian: "Nearly four in five coronavirus deaths in Oregon during the first four weeks of August were among unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals, according to new data released by the Oregon Health Authority. And roughly five in six of the 51,391 known COVID-19 infections during the same period were among people who were unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated, according to a state report released Thursday. The share of so-called breakthrough cases and deaths among fully vaccinated Oregonians remains tiny compared to the 2.4 million Oregonians who were fully vaccinated as of Aug.28, demonstrating the effectiveness of vaccines at preventing severe COVID-19."
1	i took the vaccine and guess what im still alive. these anti vax protester are pure comedy.
0	But if you’re vaccinated... you’re good right? Why do unvaccinated people have anything to do with you
1	I am obese, I will take the vaccine doctor! I will protect myself
1	petition to put all anti vaxxers on an island! They'll die quickly :D
0	I've 3 doses and got omicron so it's useless
0	The vaccines don't work all they do is weaken your immune system's response to viruses. Now watch me get banned
0	If you are triple vaxxed, test positive, and then you urge people to get vaccinated, you’re in a cult
0	God bless all those who have challenged and refused to get vaccinated
0	Pfizer broke so many regulations in the trials it's laughable at this point, and we are the joke. Stop take those vaccines!
1	America wouldn’t need a vaccine so quickly if people grew up and did what they were supposed to do during the pandemic...
1	Why is vaccinating against a rapidly mutating virus a choice? I'm not allowed to walk around with a frag granade in a public place
0	“Small fringe minority” ~ Justin Trudeau   Thousands of people protest against vaccine passports and mandates every week. But the media won’t tell you. Here is a reminder.  #JustinTrudeau  #TruckersForFreedom2022  #NoVaccinePassportsAnywhere
0	It's quite unfortunate that people will get the covid jab every year ,from pandemic to ENDEMIC
0	I DON’T TRUST THE MASK! I DON’T TRUST THE VACCINE! I DON’T TRUST THE SCIENCE! BECAUSE THEY USED TO EXPERIMENT ON “BLACK PEOPLE” IN THE NAME OF SCIENCE!
0	We got rid of liability for all vaccines in the early 90s
1	Not getting the vaccine really shows how we don't care other people.
1	Notice how few people with a medical degree actually is against the vaccine
1	#Covid_19 is just like bees. You're gonna get stung. #MaskUp and #vaccination
1	To protect our health, and promote the health and well-being of our communities. We have the moral duty to get vaccinated as soon as possible. The fight against COVID-19 depends on every one!
0	Good news. This study also demonstrates the Pfizer vaccine is protective against the ongoing variants, right?
0	if there was at least one fatal case and there were more, no one has the right for anyone to be forced to risk his life !!!!!!
1	Im glad I got the vaccine because damn this sickness was no joke, the 1st day was the WORST. Could have been worse too if I was unvaccinated so thank you!!
0	ATHLETES ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE DROPPING DEAD FROM VACCINES!!
1	I don’t want to have covid and not knowing it and murdering anyone I couldn’t live with myself that’s why I wear a mask and vaccinated all 3 shots to protect myself and all
0	I’m not getting vaccinated and promise not to go to the hospital if I get it and need to
1	The reaction America is having is very much like zombie outbreak in movies. Ignorance at first, then panics, then serious infections, then government attention
1	Antivaxers are idiots.
1	I get my first Moderna tomorrow! Yeah!
1	Please just vaccinate guys
1	Thank you to all these companies for doing the right thing. We all need to be vaccinated in order to prevent further variants and have this pandemic continue to rule our lives.
1	The US has like a surplus of vaccines and are even giving people incentives to get vaccinated, meanwhile in my country people are are trying their hardest to get vaccinated cause of scarcity. What a world we live in.
0	If you think injections of poisons that include toxic metals and aborted fetal tissue are "healthy", then you deserve every vaccine in the world.
1	I got both doses last year. For the first shot, my arm was just sore for a day. The second dose was a little bit unpleasant. Had a slight fever and runny nose for a day, but after that I was alright again. Till now I haven’t gotten sick, so that’s good! Stay safe everyone!
1	Covid isn’t killing fully vaccinated people except for a handful whose health was on the brink to begin with.
0	People this vaccine was developed in 1,5 years, vaccine before this one took 12 years to develop so you do the math this vaccine is experimental
1	It's very frustrating to read all the anti vaccine comments all over the internet. Even here in Switzerland, where we supposedly have very good general education there's an alarming rise of people spreading misinformation.
1	Vaccines are helpful but natural immunity is much better.
1	I'm strongly in favor of vaccination, and I think it's dangerous not to at least try
0	The Covid-19 Shot Information... Not a Vaccine... The Independent Opinion by Church G.
0	only father God can make think wk
0	Imagine getting 3 vaccine shots, a booster shot, all in a 2 year period (if that) and you still end up getting COVID and dying lmao.
0	Stfu lol vaccines are the pandemic
0	I will never take the so-called vaccine. I'm young and healthy!
0	It doesn’t even protect you from COVID
0	Prof. Raoult's masterful reframing! We cannot say that the vaccine stops the epidemic, it is not true! We are at 10 billion doses! When you threaten to stop treating people if they don't obey something that doesn't make sense, that's dictatorship. We have to stop.
1	I'm legit allergic to vaccines. So thanks to the rest of yall for keeping us out of the cross fire.
0	I rather die on my feet than live on my knees!!
0	I thought it was my body, my choice? I guess that only applies to the unborn…
0	These mrna vaccines are more useless as ice cubes in drinks in the north pole…
0	It must be exhausting to keep repeating logic & facts to people that aren't listening. There's no social responsibility/liability for vaccines harms so I'd suggest those enforcing the vaccines are selfish.
0	With respect to unvaccinated deaths, a large contribution of death comes in 2-7 weeks post vaccination.   The problem is that first 2 weeks are counted as unvaxxed.  But there is a strong co-relation to duration from vaxx.
0	They still won't know how "safe and effective" it for several years. Something's not right about this. If it seems too good to be true...
0	Stop calling it a vaccine!!! It does not qualify as a vaccine by definition!!!
1	Wonderful!!!! Thank you science for being a light of hope!!!!
0	Thanks but I'll be giving it a pass. Nice try though.
1	Got my first shot yesterday so far no feeling of side effect. Ty Pfrizer
1	The vaccine has been proven safe and effective by teams of scientists. You are literally killing the world by being selfish morons
0	nO VACCINE FOR ME , ITS BETTER TO GET COVID AND GET HEALED FOR BREATHING TROUBLE GO FOR HERBS ,- ALL WILL BE FINE
0	Vaccines were only supposed to be for over 65s but pharma had to get greedy
1	The covid vaccine does not cause infertility, there are two origins of this myth. One is viral Facebook posts spread by anti-crusaders. The other is that a flu-vaccine manufactured to prevent pregnancy is  a plot point from the entirely fictional TV show utopia.
1	Vaccines are like a workout for your immune system❤️☺️
0	I think the most important point here is why force it? If the vaccine is so great people should WANT it and not be FORCED to get it! That simple point is what is making people skeptical.
0	Gene editing vaccines! Hell yeah
1	"Vaxxed and relaxed, Side effects be damned! Gimme a booster!"
1	Vaccines is the hope of stop coronavirus. Mask cannot stop coronavirus. There are human factors. People can die but can’t stop working. So infected, still working. Some get infected, wont infect others.
0	THIS IS MY BODY AND MY BLOOD THAT JESUS CHRIST GAVE ME AND NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO PUT POISON INTO MY BODY. NO ONE.
1	Political view: I think vaccines should be mandatory since we can really stop the transmission without failing the economy..ie everyone get sick and no school or work
0	Isn't it criminal to put your children into mortal danger?
0	My body my choice. I haven’t had influenza ever since I stopped receiving influenza vaccines 15 years ago. My immune system is amazing.
0	We’re tired of this crap, enough is enough!!! Live with it, eat healthy and exercise. You’ll be fine.
1	I've now had my 3 shots and im happy i did, personally id take them again every time.
1	Put the anti vaxers in a bubble
0	Feed them with food not with vaccine
1	If you haven't already done your COVID vaccines it is not too late! My vaccination went great.
0	They're drawing out the pandemic and putting our kids at risk.
1	#Pakistan has successfully manufactured its own #CoronaVaccine #PakVac with the cooperation of #CanSino Bio Inc. #China
1	I’m a cater working on the front line & been working right through this pandemic. I’ve worked in a hospital & care homes with patients with covid. To say you feel useless is an understatement when you see someone dying of covid in so much pain & discomfort when all you can do is make them as comfortable as possible. Thankfully I’m double vaccinated & had my booster but I’ve had 2 out of 4 of my kids have had covid. My 17 year old daughter had it in June & she was bad, she was vomiting, high temperature, no sense of smell or taste & a really bad cough. Thankfully she didn’t need to go into hospital. My 14 year old son had it a month ago, he was lucky & was only like a really bad cold with him. They where both isolating in there rooms & I was taking food & drinks to them but made sure I wore a mask & sanatised my hands. I guess I’ve been really lucky by not catching covid, so my point to people who won’t have the vaccine, if it’s that “unsafe” the vaccine must be doing something as I’m still here after 3 jabs & avoided catching covid after being in close contact with people with covid a fair few times????
0	Mc Donald’s is offering free burgers if you get vaccinated as if Mc Donald’s ever cared about anyone’s health. Laughable!!!
0	89% people unvaccinated are recovering on their own  from the covid infection without any specific cure available...which raises the issue what is the purpose of the vaccine when  it still allows the covid infection to occur?
0	COVID-19 vaccines are growing new variants inside the bodies of vaccinated people.
1	Sad that we live in a world where people will speak against clear common sense for political gain and then literally die on that hill SMDH
0	It's crazy how you keep saying they're safe, yet the jab is on CLINICAL TRIAL until 2030.
0	This Covid is fucked up ain’t it had all 3 jabs and still test positive
0	I trust my ....my immune system
1	Got my first COVID shot today!
1	CDC monitors the safety of all COVID-19 vaccines after the vaccines are authorized or approved for use, including the risk of myocarditis in children ages 5 through 11 years.
1	you don't know "its real purpose" like you have some some special insight into some big conspiracy.  I want you to tell me exactly what is in that vaccine that is the problem, who They are who is pushing it, and exactly and precisely, in medical terms with links to peer-reviewed scientific research to back your claims up. Oh, wait...it can't be peer-reviewed cuz it's so secret. Oh well. Work around it and tell me precisely what you're so afraid of.
1	Of course we can’t blame the “vaccine” but it’s ok to blame the dead victim. RIP Kassidi.
0	If all vaccines are safe and save lives.... So why the legal immunity from vax damage then???
1	They are self righteous morons !! Who have never seen a child suffer from measles induced encephalitis!!! !!! Xx
0	This video made me want to not get it more lol
1	What truly terrifies me is that after years of hysteria, many people still do not actually know what covid is and what vaccines do and that the vaccine fanatics are the least educated group.
0	Everything that has to do with so-called covid is a scam! You should not be vaccinated and of course do not wear a mask.
1	Already got it. I really dont care about the vaccine, it really is not that deep of a situation as the conspirators say it is. I just dont understand why people are against it so much.
1	Thank you I’ve already had both shots, i’ll wait my turn for the third booster I’ve heard that 1 million people that I’m not entitled to get the shot I already going out and saying they didn’t get one wish it worked on the unvaccinated Everybody should really get vaccinated
1	OH lawd, now we have to put up with the 2nd and 3rd Generation anti-vaxxers.
0	Hi Guardian. I took all the necessary vaccines in my life, yet I refuse to take a vaccine that has not been thoroughly tested. Does that make me an anti-vaxxer? Can you label someone who has already been vaccinated willingly many times, but is being sceptical about a specific vaccine an "Anti-Vaxxer"?
0	I haven’t had the first jab and we’re not interred on these other experimental injections. Already had Delta variant and my natural immune system did great. No thanks...
0	My sons birthday this weekend. When asked what he wanted he said he only wished for two gifts. His father back from heaven and the government to stop vaccines. I couldn't give him either. Some days you just want to flip the bird to the world.
0	No proof that the vax@actually makes Covid less risky…repeating the lie doesn’t make it true.  Who’s paying to say these things…certainly not the Frontline Doctors.  A real, honest and brave doctor would prescribe IVERMECTIN!!
0	Satisfactory trials simply cannot have been conducted in the time these vaccines have been rolled out. If they give others the vaccines they may well discover the vaccines are not as efficacious as claimed. PEACE ;]
1	Anyone who thinks that vaccines aren't working against Omicron might want to review the data
1	thank you for giving the importance of why we should vaccinate
0	What about the fraudulent pandemia !?
0	Hi, I won't take that shit, does anyone have a problem with that???
0	I don't believe in scientists! How many times have scientists been wrong? NATURAL IMMUNITY is BEST!
0	Covid-19 vaccine is a scam
0	imagine a vaccine so safe you have to be coerced into taking it for a disease so deadly that you need to take a test to find out if you have it.
0	GOD GAVE US AN IMMUNITY
1	An unsurprising headline: "State trooper who told governor to "kiss my ass" over vaccine order dies of COVID." He leaves behind his wife and four kids. But you know, the far right loved him, so I'm sure it was worth it.
0	Wear a mask good for you take a vaccine good for you sick of masks good for me not taking vaccine good for me you be you I’ll be me
0	My employer told me there Ll b no work if not vaccinated. Very upsetting
1	Vaccination is the only way this country is going to get back into some semblance of normality. The scientists should be applauded.
1	If you read your own words, unvaccinated you're 32 times more likely to die does not say you won't die if you're vaccinated. You're just increasing your chances of living. Thanks for thinking I'm the chosen one, but I'm only someone who understands statistics and maths better.
0	Im 38 last time i got a shot for anything I was 15 i think. I have not gotten the common cold or the flu in 20 yrs. I dont want to get vaccinated for the covid, but im basically being forced by having to show a card just to go places or to work. I dont mind wearing a mask everywhere I go. Im holding out as long as I can.
0	Probably because these ones are so effective. They stop transmission, stop infection, stop hospitalizations...oh wait...nope, they do the opposite of those things. They do seem to stop economies and free thought though.
0	Nothing says "trust the science" like  "you can't sue us if something goes wrong."
0	I can't wait to get my 25th booster shot, then we can finally get back to normal after 15 years.....
0	The assumption that a healthy unvaccinated person is a greater risk to others than a sick vaccinated person is beyond ludicrous.
1	I will get vaccinated as soon as there is an opportunity. I can record it and send to all those with anti-vaccine views.
0	Natural immunity has always been better than a chemical. A vaccine should have only been offered to the vulnerable and those with no immune system support. Otherwise, these companies and our government just shutdown a lot of people's immune systems by forcing them into a mask.
1	Today i just had my first dose of sinovac.... Going smooth after 14 hours ..
1	Nobody should be forced...but you should get it anyway.
1	Incredible video. Literally just turned me pro vaccine, 100% brother
0	It takes at least a decade (10 years) to fully understand the potential of a vaccine on animals but lest just skip all the trials in an emergency mandate 🤡🥼🤡🥼🤡🥼🤡🥼
0	I know too many people who have had serious issues with the vaccine.
1	I have taken dose 1 and dose 2 vaccines I recommend others to take
0	Get back to us in 4 to 18 months and see if you still feel"fine"
0	My family are not taking it
1	Just here for the crack pot antivaxer comments
1	I am pro-vaccination, but I disagree with mockery. If we do not rise above such attitudes how can we expect the anti-vaccination crowd to behave with more decency than they currently are when us the pro-vaccine crowd are behaving with the same lack of decency towards them? I hardly believe that mockery will help people change their minds and vaccinate. We are so polarized already and split into camps, why contribute more? We should draw attention to covid deaths of those anti-vaccination, we absolutely should, but mockery is not the right way to do so. I am actually disappointed that  mockery is even taken into consideration. Can we really not have more balanced and healthier views on this?
0	I'm seeing un poked healthy people recover from Rona in 48 hours . Do not get poked unless your elderly or have health conditions,  you don't need it ....kids definitely not it's outrageous . Thrombosis is not rare neither is heart inflammation ...it is rife, I know many personally .
0	There’s something bigger going on people. Something much bigger in play, and for those who have been fully vaccinated, you’ll find out soon enough…
0	My main concern is that in this vaccine mRNA is used instead of the virus itself. This type of vaccine has never been used before ever. I do get my vaccines but they are different from the covid vaccine using dead viruses or inactive viruses. So I doubt if this type of vaccine (mRNA) is truly safe or later will be proven unsafe.
1	If you read historical work about previous pandemics, it seems that fear, panic, hysteria, and protests are quite "normal" for this sort of situation.  We like to think that we are living in a more enlightened age, but human nature remains the same.
1	Get vaccinated, save lives, protect the NHS. #CoronavirusVaccine #OxfordAstraZeneca
1	My daughter has a severe egg allergy and many vaccines are suspended in a type of egg protein.  I strongly believe in vaccines because I have an autoimmune disease and heart condition.  So I as a parent took my daughter to a specialist who did all her vaccines in divided dosages and we stayed in the office for 2 hours after each dosage. She is now a healthy 14 year old and has outgrown the egg allergy and has had ALL of her vaccines
1	I just got vaccinated!
0	COVID vaccines prevent life
0	This is the best day for me, I’m Canadian and part Austrian, MY PEOPLE EVERYWHEREE ARE STANDING UP AGAINST TYRANNY!!!
1	Vaccines save lives, deter transmission of this virus, and keep the healthcare system from collapsing under the weight of the pandemic.
1	In the US, EVERYONE has personal knowledge of unvaxed people who died or were severely damaged by Covid. Local police officers, family, friends, work associates, neighbors. But NO ONE knows anyone killed or harmed by a vax
1	Hello, and thanks for this video! I'm a health care worker and have had all my vaccinations thus far, but have become a vaccine sceptic, due to being bombarded by the anti vaxx narrative. But, also, I must admit, it didn't help my scepticism the way that the government has imposed vaccinations on us so aggressively, I believe it should be a choice, not forced onto us. Anyways, I'm going to finally book my first vaccine shot this week, after seeing your video. I've had enough of the conspiracy theories and all the surrounding bs.
0	Gotta keep coming up with new reasons for another round of shots.  I'm glad I'm not part of the great experiment.  I refuse to become a spike protein factory.  This guy is Phizer ' s  little puppet.
1	I just had 3 people die of COVID last 2 weeks. Both parents and the daughter that was taking care of them. Also know dozens of people that have taken the vaccine and they are fine.
1	Thank you for creating this video. It's very frustrating to read all the anti vaccine comments all over the internet. Even here in Switzerland, where we supposedly have very good general education there's an alarming rise of people spreading misinformation.
0	I will trust the vaccine when all CDC employees get the vaccine.  If the vaccine worked why wouldn’t it be mandatory for everyone
1	Nothing is 100% but the vax most certainly lowers risk of catching it significantly 70-80%.
1	Vaccines don’t save lifes, vaccinations do.
0	How safe is corona 19 vaccine when it has not gone through in 8 months which normally at least 9 years and is normally permanent , this vaccine requires a further dose and is not permanent. Now apparently there is another varient of the virus is this vaccine going to be ideal for this one ? I know that vaccines were used to eradicate smallpox, diphtheria measles , I cannot see why the measles vaccine can be used solo and the other two also!!
0	Wow, a vaccine as effective as NaCl. Oh what’s that? A cookie...
1	According to CDC website: "Vaccinated people can still become infected and have the potential spread the virus to others, although AT MUCH LOWER RATES than unvaccinated people.
0	If you have full blown AIDS, the flu and are Covid positive w/ symptoms—hospitals will treat you, so long as you took the Covid vax. If you are Covid negative and in need of a heart transplant, they will watch you die if you have not agreed to take the vaccine. Satan is real.
0	Vaccinations take effect within days to weeks or not at all. There has never been and is not a single vaccination with a side effect that only occurs years later. This would also be difficult to explain theoretically. Vaccines will soon be phased out, and once they're gone, there's nothing they can do.
0	Vaccine of death
1	Vaccination is the most effective way to NOT get Covid to start with. 900K Americans have died and you're still pushing this lie. Why?
1	the vast majority of people who get vaccinated dont' have it worse than unvaccinated people
1	Hurray! I also just convinced a staunchly vegan co-worker to get vaccinated, and she got her first shot yesterday. She was holding out for a vegan alternative.
1	I’m getting my vaccine in 6 days
0	Im not anti-vaxx but this one is very new. Like i need more time to see how the vaccine will affect out body in the long run. There might be some long term side effects that we haven't seen yet coz the vaccine is very new.
1	COVID-19 vaccination causes a more predictable immune response than infection with the virus that causes COVID-19.
1	My kids always got booster shots growing up for measles, mumps etc. This is no different. This is how we beat this awful disease.
0	More benefits for big pharmas, and more risks for us!
0	Well only a brain dead idiot would class the clot shots as safe. You have a vast Choice of potential illnesses to consider: myocarditis, strokes, etc, etc. I suppose you can hone in on your vaccine choice depending on which disability you would like to take a chance on. J&J would seem to have most chance of giving you myocarditis..  Here’s the damage after vaccination in the EU. The US is similar. The injuries and deaths are reported to be around 40 times underreported by academics. So the deaths may be as high as 1.5 million! The injuries come in then at an amazing 130 million. The US will be similar.  This is a fucking joke right?A proper vaccine gives immunity for around 4 years. The J&J immunity wears off after 2 months! Pfizer after around 6. So you will need endless boosters, wheras natural immunity is longer lasting.  So how do these vaccines boosters ( what a term ) handle variants? They don’t.Well Pfizer needs to jab kids with the clot shot in order to maintain their liability shield - translation they make $80 billion in revenue per annum, but pay out zilch, zero, nada to vaccine damaged people. If they did, they would be bankrupt in months.  But at least the kids are safe. Nope.https://dailyexpose.uk/2022/01/12/20-facts-your-doctor-forgot-to-tell-you-about-vaccines/ Whereas Ivermectin can handle all phases of covid with no or near zero injuries or deaths ( from the ivermectin itsel ).  Recently released DARPA documents:...... Japans huge decrease in covid cases after ivermectin usage.  ( big Pharma with that Ferret Fauci killed off Hydroxychloroquine ( he previously recommended it ) and ivermectin as if they were shown to be viable treatments, then the Energency clot shots would not be allowed . Robert Malone estimated this cost 500,000 lives ).  There needs to be a Nuremberg Court for all of these bastards who sold their soul to big Pharma. 12 were hung at the last one. A similar number need to be hung for Justice this time.
0	GOD IS MORE POWERFUL THAN VACCINE NOT BEC.YOU ARE VACCINATED you are safe so.tell people to pray eat good food exercise drink more water .Let us see the side effect of what you give to people bec.we are not the same...
0	It's to late for the vaxed they made their choice unvaxed stay strong.
1	Covid 19 vaccines are reasonably safe and effective. If you don't take the vaccine, you have to face the Covid 19. It's far more dangerous to face the Covid 19.
0	So I'll keep getting a mild cold? Cool thanks for the heads up. What's the guarantee that a Vax for whatever the strain is protects better than the current stock?
0	Don't worry guys, the worlds least trusted source assures us everything is fine.
1	I keep thinking that this pandemic is planet Earth trying to save itself. The people who don't believe in science and vaccines also tend to not believe in climate change or the need to protect our natural resources. Perhaps the virus (including likely new, possibly worse, ones) is our planet's attempt to get rid of those who are destroying it.
1	If youre eligible for a #CovidVaccine booster and you haven’t got it yet contact your GP,pharmacy or state vax hub to get boosted. After the sore arm wears off you’ll feel better for it.
1	I was proud to get the COVID-19 vaccine earlier today at Morehouse School of Medicine. I hope you do the same!
0	My concern is that this is the first time mRNA has been used on humans in such a wide scale before. The experts say it is safe, but how can we know for sure that there will not be long term side effects? I'm not taking the vaccine for a while.
0	Hmm so because most of us are carrying a smartphone, that is reason enough to let government run roughshod over privacy and individual rights? And by the time a vaccine passport even comes out, we would already be herd immune.
1	When you don’t get vaccinated and you get Covid, going into the hospital fucks up everyone’s life. Don’t be that asshole. Don’t be that selfish son of a bitch. Get vaccinated.
1	It’s just a little weird how many anti-vaxxers swap sides when they’re in hospital dying of this non-pandemic virus
0	Because it's NOT A VACCINE,,,IT'S POISON
1	Thanks a lot, unvaccinated douchebags
1	I always feel sorry for the loss of any life. I feel even more sorry for the medical staff who have to fight to keep people alive, at risk to their own lives and mental health. It’s just frustrating when much of this is preventable and I resent those who deliberately spread disinformation.
1	They are ignorant and selfish if they don't get the shot.
1	Glad that there is a wonder vaccine on the horizon cos these ones clearly don't work.
1	Covaxin is safest and best vaccine among all
1	He probably wouldn’t be dead if he’d had the vaccine
0	People keep saying that it's only the unvaccinated who are dying. These official UK government figures show that around 90% of deaths are in the vaccinated population. They of course try to explain it away with adjusted rates etc. But the fact of the matter is, in raw numbers, in Britain, by far the most deaths are occuring to vaccinated people
1	I have had both vaccines thank you to the scientists
0	I like the lady who said “I’m not just going to get on a bandwagon like the rest and just get the vaccine”. I feel the same.
1	Here we go! Grateful to be among the first group of vaccinated healthcare workers in Tampa
0	You don't need immunity from flu
0	Vaccines are litterally useless and cost taxpayers money
1	COVID-19 vaccines are safe. Please dear human, do vaccinate as early as possible. Save yourself and save your family from COVID-19.
1	Anti-Vax Parent: “I am worried my child will get measles.” Me: “Then vaccinate your kid.” Anti-Vax Parent: “No. Vaccines are poison.” Me: Facepalm
1	Can we get to 70% vaccinated so I can get my free damn Budweiser already!
0	Disgusting! Parents will find out what "free from liability means" soon after getting the vaccine.
1	You have your “freedom” to decide what’s best for you and your family. Your choice comes with consequences. You have placed your family in the no fun zone. See it’s all about “you”. Stop complaining and be a good human..get vaccinated
0	If the vaccine is safe, why did two of the FDA's top scientists step down a week after Pfizer's COMIRNATY was licensed?
1	The more people vaccinated no matter what vaccine the faster we shutdown VARIANTS.
0	No we don't need them.
1	I see the COVID-19 vaccines as a medical miracle— for myself and my family.
1	Thank you very much Dr John. I don't know what I'd do without all the updates you give. I hope we get some vaccines here in Egypt soon. Thanks again!
1	I just got my Pfizer-Biontech vaccine. Thank you all. I may not meet you all in person, but I am very thankful.
1	presumably they had their vaccines and had a milder dose of COVID than they might have done. Much to be thankful for.
1	Appreciate the sharing of the science behind the vaccine.  The best channel that doesn't use fear mongering tactics in the content.
0	It's now worked its way through a substantial amount of the "vaccinated."
1	#Pizer has announced that their #CovidVaccine is 90% effective..
1	More vaccine, this is what saves us!
1	75% of all adults are fully vaccinated. Congratulations to our fellow citizens for this momentous feat. Proud of all those who are making our vaccination drive a success.
1	I’m sending this to all my friends who don’t want to get vaccinated, thank you
1	what are the side effects? I had none. From my perspective, all you people talking about all the serious side effects are the ones talking crazy, because I didn't have any.
0	There are three people in the immediate area and one person I know a distance away all who have passed within 48 hours of receiving a vaccine..
0	because of the fact that people participating in a phase 3 trial have to volunteer- people who got those experimental vaccines most likely were less likely to get covid in the first place. that’s my biggest concern
0	Why did they require people to sign a waiver if the vaccines are safe?
1	Slightly biased towards mRNA based vaccine but nevertheless, a very simplified and excellent video on why vaccine in general is important. Keep up the good work!
0	NO FUCKING SHIT!!! NONE OF THE VACCINES HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH STOPPING COVID. PLEASE PROVE ME WRONG!!!
1	I am so sorry for children with anti-vax parents
1	My daughter tested positive for covid so it's likely that mild cold we all had was actually covid. The vaccine we all got probably helped in making the symptoms be so mild.
0	I'm not getting vaccinated ever !!
1	THANK YOU for your "vaccinate the world" message! It's so important. I live in the US, I'm young and healthy. I did not get a booster. Other people need those shots more than I do. I noticed that delta and omicron came from areas with lower vaccination. I wish we quit worrying about the handful of anti-vaxxers in rich nations and bring the vaccines where they can do the most good.
1	I giot the vaccine, no side effects!
0	My mom made me get the vaccine. And I swear if my kid comes out being messed up then I’m gonna be pissed.
1	Blaming vaccines because your child had a negative reaction to them is like blaming cheese for being lactose intolerant. It’s nobody’s fault. It’s the luck of the draw.
1	I always practice safe sex, but I skip protection when dating an anti-vaxx woman, because it’s better to pay child support for 8 years than 18.
1	I got the vaccine and three months later we decided to try for another baby and I got pregnant on the first try. We have a very healthy baby boy!
0	Unbelievable! Most have probably already had it....vacinne doesn't keep them from getting it...
1	I used to be skeptical about the Covid vaccine but the more science I hear about it, like this, it eases my mind.
0	My trust issues said no 👍🏻
0	After receiving the #vaccine from #China, #HongKong has recorded 7 #deaths! Please think twice when you are being offered #Sinovac!
1	You are much more likely to face myocarditis from COVID than you are from the vaccine. At this rate, the virus is coming for all of us. Protect yourself, while there's still time. Even if COVID were only as bad as the flu, the flu is capable of killing you too
1	Great video, I'll be sending it to my vaccine hesitant family members
0	Then why are thousands upon thousands of women posting comments about their irregular menstrual cycles or not having their periods for months??? IMO that’s a huge red flag & something to consider about if you’re planning to start a family.
0	When my sisters,  step mother, and girlfriend are in the medical field in different states, different positions, and different medical groups are told they should not get the vaccine I'll happily skip it along with the flu shot since every time I get a flu shot I end up in the hospital and 8 years without a shot and 8 years flu free...
1	Got my first dose! Very happy!
1	No condoms or birth control used. No sunblock used. No vaccine. I don’t get it. Why do they not like protection?
1	Pls take it
1	Do Anti-vaxers realize that the food and drinks we consume in America have more GMO and hormones added which should be of more concerns than a COVID vaccine.
1	Yes, but immunity through vaccination is more long-lasting than immunity through infection.
1	you shouldn't trust the Covid vaccine too much for now, but I'll assure you that there will be better vaccines in the future and it's going to finally have your parent's trust.
0	Yeah that makes sense. You're taking a shot to keep you from dying but you have a chance of dying anyway. You have to cross your fingers and hope you aren't one of the unlucky few
1	I got my first covid shot two days ago, it didn't really hurt. It's like if you pinch yourself with your fingernail.
0	I still don't trust vaccine from China and Russia
0	Shout out to all the unvaccinated who’ve had covid fully recovered and still have their immune system intact
0	Just another reminder to all my unvaxxed brethren: HOLD THE F@CKING LINE!!!
0	So the boss\medical expert from 'moderna',is saying this..and no one else is questioning a company pushing the virus panic button...lol.
0	I'm not going to get any sort of covid 19 vaccine ok! I REFUSE AND I COMPLETELY RESIST!!! I don't need this!
1	Get vaccinated
1	I had the vaccine and I am pro vaccine but I’m against forced vaccination. I believe everyone has the fundamental right to decide what goes into their body.
0	Pls people dont believe that save your life its only busines for pharmacy all around the world stay strong angel🥺u are strong that will be good🥺
1	Get vaccinated guys :) Get boosted for 18+ age groups as well (especially elderly) Vaccine helps reduce the severity if you get COVID meaning reduce the chances on you being sent into an ICU, put on Ventilator etc
1	I’m tired. If everyone would vax this garbage would be over in the US.
1	I want to encourage everyone to become vaccinated! The life you save maybe my grandchild!
1	As a fully vaccinated RN, I am quite fed up with the misinformation! Thanks for clarifying for the masses!
1	100% true and real. Getting vaccinated is a safer way for you to develop immunity from covid. 19. Rather than getting infected by the virus. Due to ignorance so many citizens are falling infected under covid.19 and experiencing difficulties. So to avoid such inconvenience its much more better to take a vaccine two doses for avoiding risk of Corona. Don't believe such innocent persons beliefs and take vaccine atonce.please.
0	A 95% effective vaccine for a virus that has a 99.997% recovery rate anyway.  I can see why it’s so important to vaccinate EVERYONE.
1	A friend of mine just told me the other day that her cousin, who was an unvaccinated nurse, died from covid. I just don't get it. How can people be so blind to the science?
0	SoWhyAre the majority of hospitalizations vaccinated ppl? Riddle me that…
0	You can have my vaccine I'm 69 and doing fine 98% survival rate btw
1	It is mild and safe.
0	I didn’t even take the flu shot so imma respectfully decline covid vaccine shot. If you feel like you need it then do what you gotta do. I’m not saying don’t get. I’m just saying I’m healthy and feel I don’t need it.
0	Yes part of my concern is long term effects that are unknown at present. The vaccine hasn’t been tested for the long term dangers so thats my number one fear. Also have concerns of the Bell’s palsy and death possibly of being related to vaccine.
1	Just had my booster , sore injection site for 4 days and feeling tired for about 1day . First 2 was quite similar . Most of my friends and family members have a very similar side effects as me . A few did have a bit more severe side effects but only about 1-2% among the people I know .
0	It will edit you genes, put new thoughts in your head, and destroy your body. i choose fema camp over covid vaccine anyday. Repeating a lie big enough does not work on me. wamp, wamp.
1	Don't wait until you're in the hospital to get a vaccine. Do your research from REPUTABLE sources because your life does depend on it. I'm sorry for the family that he left behind, hopefully his passing will educate others on the dangers of misinformation and the importance of vaccinations.
1	Ending the pandemic is the most important thing, so take the vaccine
0	Can we join the fight AGAINST the vaccine????
0	I got both doses last year. For the first shot, my arm was just sore for a day. The second dose was a little bit unpleasant. Had a slight fever and runny nose for a day, but after that I was alright again. Till now I haven’t gotten sick, so that’s good! Stay safe everyone!
0	I’ll get the vaccine soon, very soon in geologic time. In about 15 years.  This is a massive experiment. The vaccines may be a great technology for a future pandemic ..but it is insanity to test them on such large numbers of people at once.  Resisting that insanity by refusing a vaccine, for at least 5 years, maybe longer, is not just a matter of safety for the younger half of the population, it is a moral duty.  It is the most pro-vaccine stance you can take.  Why? Because if this experiment goes wrong all vaccine programmes will suffer. Many people may never accept a vaccine again.  This experiment is a big stupid gamble, make no mistake.  Our Covid vaccine evangelists are have lost their minds with this mass test, now being rolled into children.  It is our duty as rational scientific beings to walk out on it.
0	All you little pro vaxx people need to wake up and see that you're litteraly being brainwashed.
0	Let’s not forget doctors pushed cigarettes and said they were healthy just do it. Woopsy sorry about the side effects can’t help you.
0	Canadian unvaxxed here, and it's not because I don't believe in vaccination I absolutely do. But these are not vaccines. 4-6 month efficacy. Still can catch it. litany of side effects. What's the point? There literally is NO reason to take it. There is no benefit.
1	I just got my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine! I’m so excited because I work at a grocery store and interact with a lot of people.
1	Now we need a vaccine to stop the spread of stupidity as in antivaxers and antimask types!
1	I was initially distrustful of the vaccination until I spoke to my Dad who caught covid but is still alive, later he recovered from it.
1	These vaccines have been rushed to the public too quickly
1	I have been fighting with mine since the beginning of the year. I thought I had them convinced, but then they would back out. They were concerned about potential side effects. Well, they both ended up getting Covid about a month ago and my dad spent a week in the hospital. Now they are both planning on getting their shots as soon as their doctor gives them the green light.
0	I work in a nursing home and I’m not vaccinated, my supervisor is and he got covid twice like come on now
0	Their is no benefit because it doesn't work obviously
1	One of the biggest issues I take with anti-vaxxers is when they point to the world we live in, created and protected by vaccines, and use that to argue that we don't need vaccines. The ONLY reason certain diseases are "rare" is because we vaccinate for them. To then focus on the individual outlier cases of adverse effects and pretend that they are somehow indictive of the whole picture is dishonest and misleading. It plays on the worst fears of parents for their children.
1	I don’t think they should study someone who has fertility issues in the first place. I have no issues conceiving any of my children. I got the vaccine and three months later we decided to try for another baby and I got pregnant on the first try. We have a very healthy baby boy!
1	I remind people who (still) think that the vaccine is magnetic, that it is connected to 5G, that it is a global plot to control the population or to kill us all, etc. that Drogue Info Service is open free of charge on 0800 23 13 13, 7 days a week from 8am to 2am
0	No. Many polio vaccines gave polio. Many TB vaccines gave TB. I doubt if any vaccine is more good than harm.
1	got my first dose of Vaccine , this can be a help to my country
0	Iv had every vaccine in life but I won't be touching this . I am not an anti vaxxer I'm just not being bullied into anything. My body my choice
1	just got my first shot and I’m feeling great! Thank you Ted for sharing this important message and I wish everyone a great day, except for the anti vax people commenting here. Stay safe!
1	Everyone needs to take it
0	The omicron wave is hitting a population exhausted by a nearly two-year pandemic and its response, with massive tensions evident daily.
1	There are plenty of reasons to be frustrated with those not getting the vaccine, don't need to invent fake ones.
1	Thank God I've had my vaccine and booster so COVID isn't a death sentence for me like it is the un-vaxxed, but I still don't feel safe in public not knowing everyone's vax status.
0	Great news. Hopefully we'll learn a lot from their experience so we can avoid the same problems and mistakes.
1	So you're saying that in terms of "freedom", there is no difference between having a choice, and not having a choice to take a vaccine? I am very much pro vaccine but I don't understand how you can say that mandatory vaccination is not a loss of freedom.
1	Inject that shit into my veins.
1	Thank you for this. It actually makes me curious about the COVID vaccines instead of being all skeptical.
0	Thing is everyone that’s got the shot have a HIGER chance of being sick lol
1	Hi I need to get an AstraZeneca Booster
0	Find a vaccine that works and I will be on board. You really should find another name for the jab. A vaccine it is not! A vaccine works the Covid vaccine does not! Maybe just call it a Covid shot like the annual flu shot! Just a thought for you wizards!
0	i was ok for 2 years of pandemic,but catch covid from cooworker,he been fully vaccinated and had covid second time,i was the only one unvaccinated at work and about 6 ppl been positive as well.There is 15 of us all together in company.So it did spred very easy,no matter you are vaxxed or not.
0	Of course not. It’s good news!
1	Omicron does seem to less associated with severe disease. That’s probably a combination of both factors - the virus is less likely to cause severe disease in the unvaccinated and the background level of immunity is very much higher than it was in previous waves. That’s particularly true in places like the Gauteng in South Africa, where more than 70% of people had evidence of prior infection before omicron appeared.
1	Pro vaccine: I provide an essential service for the community  Anti vaccine: I take up space
0	The rushness of releasing these vaccines is what worries me.
0	@Issac Botox ? I never had it or will . I consider myself very healthy I had to take this vaccine because I love to travel and fear to loose my job
1	I believe the vaccine is safe. It's proven to be effective. I believe, if you can, you should get vaccinated.
0	What most people fail to understand is, vaccines are only a way to infect some one with a virus. The difference between that and natural infection is it is manufactured and deemed to be safe.
0	Explore REASONS for NOT wanting to get vaccinated
1	I’m skeptical that those who are anti-vaccine truly understand the risk/benefit ratio paradigm.
1	why do people not understand the concept of if you're vaccinated you have, at least, less chances of being infected and/or hospitalized
1	Microsoft somehow has a liquid chip tracker inside vaccine? These people are beyond clueless...
0	It is a back-and-forth kind of game. Soon we will realize that all the vaccinations were in fact aiding the virus to grow stronger.
0	My friend's 83 year old mom, was getting on pretty well for her age. After the second vaccine she development body tremors and had to move in with her daughters and is now not well and insentient.  She used to be very sharp, and now is repeating herself all the time.
0	Never bow, never comply. No jab, no swab, no mask, no fear, no regret.
0	I do not believe these are the cause of ASD.  But I do believe I should have the right to decide what will be injected in my future children's bodies and the government should not be making that decision for me.  Even if it was proven they did, I'd rather have a child on the spectrum and having to pay for their care and services then making funeral arrangements.
0	I'm not getting no vaccine I've heard to much bad about it
1	Vaccines are the best way to protect workers and our economy. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
0	We've done a lot of testing using mRNA vaccine's... That haven't been that successful. Just take this new one we made in 6 months okay
0	Frankly to put the blame on the people who are not vaccinated who don't go out that they can't go to the restaurant not take the train and we just told them that it's their fault if people die I think we're walking on our heads here, I don't understand why you demonize people who just put doubts and we have to take the word of our politicians and the scientist when several times they lied to us. You should more turn your hatred against the government that left the hospitals dead for more than 20 years and to all this pharmaceutical lobby that have lawsuits in the ass like nobody in the world. Kisses
0	The vaccines too have a high kill rate among the elderly, that's why Norway has stopped.
1	The vaccine works for the vast majority of people, and public health campaigns are about collective safety, not individual safety.
1	With 26,000 city workers still unvaccinated Saturday, those who haven’t complied with NYC's COVID-19 vaccine mandate will be put on unpaid leave starting Monday. https://t.co/vKbI26aJf9
0	My neighbour has had the covid jab, she now has headaches constantly and feels ill
0	My friend has bels palsy. Another had a heart attack a week after 2nd shot. Those side effects dont seem small to me. Coupled with these companies are not responsible for anything that happens to these patients, ill wait 5 more  years to see the long term effects of this experimental vaccine
0	NO TO COVID-19 VACCINATION Do not let them add you into their number of deaths they want.
1	The majority of Canadians support VACCINATED WORKING TRUCKERS
0	I’m just waiting for Pfizer to say pets also need vaccines and the boosters.
0	At this point, the ONLY reason vaccination is being pushed is for $$$
1	Please vaccinate
0	Lmao. Sure, if you consider the crooked media and Fraudci and his ilk 'well researched.' I for one wouldn't trust them to mow my lawn, let alone with my life. I'll take my chances with a 99.9% survival rate virus.
1	You know what's even more rude? Exposing everyone around you to a disease that can kill them. It's kind of hard to imagine something more rude than killing people.
1	It's worth noting, preventing infections is still kind of a goal. Obviously preventing hospitalizations frees up ICU beds for unvaccinated or unvaccinatable people, but preventing infections is vital to promoting herd immunity, which is a desirable outcome. That said, any vaccine is far better than no vaccine.
1	As scientist and medical professionals have been saying since before this started: there is no single magic bullet. Epidemiology consists of multiple layers of protection, each of which reduces one or more of the risk of infection, transmission, or severity
0	That guy looks and sounds so trustworthy... I'm surprised he didn't say to download his ebook linked in description. This is a ridiculous money making machine and we are getting speeches from sales and marketing guys at companies that benefit from all this chaos. At the same time preventative treatments are a myth and nobody focuses on minimising risk... This is a circus, where people just stomp on hippocratic oath.
0	Vaccines stop viruses and diseases. This mRna shot is experimental bullshit, and its dangerous.
0	“Future mutations” 🤔...lets see where that leads to the ones that took it
0	I have been vaxxed (no booster) and am on the tail end of Covid.  My husband and kids have it (not vaxxed).  Guess who felt the worst?! Yup… me :(
1	Vaccinated to be part of a solution oriented society polite to each other for the other's sake.
1	Mumps, measles, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, small pox, pertussis, typhoid, polio...etc. Must be a reason these diseases are nearly eradicated. It's like there was some sort of shot or something.
0	You don't know that the vaccine is safe. You're a human petri dish.
1	I am pro vax, I am vaccinated and I don’t think that unvaccinated people should die :(
0	if the vaccine worked, vaccinated wouldn't be worried about unvaccinated. FACT.
1	I love how a person outside the medical field is trying to say a person inside the medical field knows less. She's trying to show the world that the vaccines don't work before they came out and said the vaccines aren't going to protect you from covid
1	Get your kids vaccinated. Before they spread it to you!
1	Don't be fooled by fake news, vaccines are secure and only a fool will not take the chance of protect it self
1	It's unfathomable that people are STILL walking around unvaccinated!!!! I keep making comments in the hopes that my words can help someone. If I can help just one person, that's one more person that can possibly be saved.
0	(Note: virus doesn’t cause clots , its the medicine that does ) What the carrying mother given? # #covidVaccine plandemic #CrimesAgainstHumanity #SaveChildren
0	got my first shot today, i am NOT getting my second.....my mother was in hospital and they refused to let me in until i had 2 shots !!!!!!!!!! i could NOT SEE MY OWN MOM !!!!!!!!!!! welcome to COMMUNIST CANADA !!!!! i took her out of hospital after my first shot today!!!!!!!...and thats it. i figured i aint getting bullied around !!
0	EVERYONE SHOULD REFUSE ANY VACCINE UNTIL ALL DATA IS AVAILABLE & THE PRODUCERS OF THE DRUG CAN BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY INJURIES! Period!
1	I’m so sick of people citing cases of people getting Covid while vaxxed as some sort of evidence of why they shouldn’t get the vaccine. Vaccines don’t necessarily stop transmission BUT they do SAVE LIVES.
0	The weak ass vaccine is to blame for these mutations. It doesn’t kill the virus
1	Anyone arguing against vaccines doesn't care about science or logic anyways so it's irrelevant what they will and won't use against you.
0	I'm supposed to get the vaccine because he got a side effect?
1	I hope this pandemic teaches anti-vaccine people to get their children a vaccine. They don't cause autism or brain damaage. If you are anti-vaccine and reading this, your precious child/children could die because of you. If you truly loved them then get them their shots.
0	Majority people in hospital with Covid at the moment are double jabbed. Its clear by now that the vaccine in not working as good as they thought it would.
1	Great great news for kids to finally be able to get vaccinated!
1	Had both Pfizer shots. Barely noticeable symptoms. Glad I got vaccinated !
0	I regard any attempt to force this vaccine on me as an assault and I would use any means available to defend myself.
1	Yes. I want to be able to offer safety to those who cant get it, and not be a risk to them.
0	im vaccinated and i feel like im dieing and i wish wasent forced to ingect stuff in my blood.
1	I hope to get the booster this weekend.
0	its now been proven that the vaccine does more harm statistically to under 30's than a covid infection
1	This is embarrassing. Polio vaccine,for instance, didn't completely keep you from Polio. It kept you from getting a bad case. The reason it has worked...and this is always the case...is bc a vast majority of ppl got the vaccine. This is no different.
1	For the first time in history, the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who refuse to take it.
1	Happy Sunday. COVID-19 Vaccine 3rd dose done
0	Vax doesn't work and is still EUA despite being "approved"
1	Nobody should ever be forced to inject anything into their body, meanwhile I have to live around unvaccinated people coughing and sneezing.... Oh okay
0	All these people and kids that are getting it are going to end up looking like Quasimodo
1	Who says you can't have both? How does taking a vaccine destroy one's liberty?
0	The benefits to big pharma outweighs the risk to the vaccinated. Notice they said this without saying who benefits.
0	They don’t work. That’s why you need 20 booster shots. It’s just about money and power now. Let’s go Brandon! FJB!!!
1	get vaccinated please, we need to be done
1	To me the entire situation reminds me when I was a kid . I thought I knew it all at 13  years of age and whatever my parents said I wanted to do the opposite. Why, because I felt I was an adult and my parents had no right . So I did a lot of foolish things . Everything my parents told me not to do I did . In my head I am an adult and I had free will to do what I want when I want . Fast forward ⏩. It’s astonishing 30,40, 50, 60, 70 , 80, 90 year olds , have them same stupid concept I had as a child ?? Is it mental health ?
0	Isn’t it funny that you are encouraged to go to another doctor for “a second opinion” but there can only be one opinion when it comes to an experimental vaccine?
1	Vaccines have been tested more than any other pharmaceutical product ever. I've done searches on "X vaccine safety" and on "ingredient X safety" on PubMed, and the smallest number of hits was over 3,000.
0	You can still get covid, and you can still spred it to others, so why should you take the vaccine?
1	The problem isn’t the vaccine mandate; the problem is some anti-vaxx truckers who want to wreck the supply chain and bring about some kind of libertarian revolution in Ottawa.
1	That being said, once the vaccine is widely available (or when the Fall 2021 semester arrives, whichever is first), I will happily go get mine too.
1	Just got my first dose yesterday. Get vaccinated, people!
1	Just a reminder, in the 2018-19 flu season, 224 people died. 1,153 have died of covid-19 in the last 7 days
1	“I would die first”. Fine. Get infected, stay home, don’t beg for treatment, and die. But instead, you’ll go to the ICU and become an expensive burden. Like the man in Buffalo MN who was moved to Texas. I hope his wife spends every penny she has paying the hospitals for their stupidity. In the meantime keep your Neanderthal views to yourself.
0	I got my own vaccine; it's called immune system.
1	They forgot about the broken healthcare system that’s in worse shape now.
1	Yes with Vaccines, let's save lives from the chances of disease and dying from Covid-19, in this way let's hope to end the pandemic
1	I am also fully vaxxed and believe vaccines are safe for the vast majority of people.
0	As a 16 year old I didn't want the vaccine but I was pressured by my friends and parents to have it. I've had one dose and I feel so terrible and sick, I might not even be able to go into school tomorrow because of it.
0	I don't trust the covid vaccine!!
0	Australia - Military press conference. Freudian Slip or Brain Fart? “You should remember that the consequences of the vaccines are worse than any of the potential side effects”
1	When my turn comes I'm opting for the lead vaccine
1	I am fully vaccinated and the peace of mind I feel is the opposite of the helplessness I felt for so long. Living with a fully vaccinated person as well. I'm very grateful.
1	I had both shots ..nada zip zero side effects..well..probably nothing but is it normal to eat raw carrots a lot more now?
1	I’m a RN who lost my brother in law to COVID delta variant . I believe that the priority should be early intervention , it was to late for him .
0	I've known more people whose health for worse after the shot than before it.
0	I never got it and I never will. Nothing they say or do will change my mind on that deadly "vaccine"
1	Originally Answered: How can we trust that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe? i am the living proof telling that vaccines does not harm you they just make you safe  i had my vaccine two months ago i am completely fine and i even have friends who got infected by infected even after vaccination but the severity is very less  so get vaccinated be safe  here is a video which may help you
0	How can you ease people’s fears about long term effects. Why was this deemed safe so quickly. If I was 60 I might would take it being mid forties I don’t know if it’s worth the risk.
0	Show me the evidence that it is completely safe. Many people in my company get very sick immediately after taking the stab. My sons neighbor died and my sister got blood clots in her legs.
1	fantastic that 1 in 5 adults have now had their first covid vaccine. i want to thank all involved
1	If you're still worried about covid, fine. Feel free to get vaccinated, boosted, wear a mask and socially distance. Don't impose these choices on everyone else.
0	Sweden have just said NO to vaccinating under 11! So......do your own investigating!
0	If there's risk, there must be choice.
0	Only because the vaxxes kill you before you can develop long covid...
0	These vaccines are as much use as an ash tray on a motorbike. Same as masks
0	They are covering up side effects
1	Remember, if you don't vaccine, you are a vicious murderer. Look at your child's corpse when you choose to not vaccinate. Remember that is your choice. Remember it.
0	I was never hesitant. I knew while the vaccines were being created that I was never going to get one. I don't need shots to protect me from Covid because I'm in good health. Maybe you're influenced by what talking heads tell you, but I'm not. I do my own thing.
1	We need to educate people about vaccination.
1	I find it amazing that people are willing to put the lives of doctors and nurses at risk, because they are too cowardly to get the vaccine. You read social media and believe the idiots spreading false information as your uneducated and have low IQ. You anti vaxxers have put the lives of the most vulnerable at risk...... You're ignoring professors at the expense of others lives. I feel ashamed of you all.
0	After what we’ve seen and experienced and learned in the last 18 months I wouldn’t trust any of these people as far as you can throw them
1	For sure, my grandma is already vaccinated so once I get mine me and gram gram are gonna chill
0	The truth is that each booster you take increase your VAIDS. It's already happening, the vaccinated are sick all the time, their immune system is weakened, why? So you can get told to get more shots.
1	I really don't believe they would chip you through a vaccine when everyone already has smartphones.
1	Vaccines save lives. Your life, your family’s lives, your friends lives.
0	54 live in Florida, no covid vaccine and yet somehow my wife and I are still here. Not sick once through all of this yet we went for dinner weekly, shopping without masks weekly. I guess we are just lucky eh! Maybe we are healthy, stay in shape and eat well.
0	I will refuse!
1	I got both shots back in April. and I'm fine. You're all paranoid...
0	We dont need any more vaccines. We need a huge national chill pill and get back to business as usual. It. Is. Just. A. Cold
0	Lab rats .. People dying, blood clots & inflammation of the heart after the vaccine. Just the beginning.. we are making a "vaccine" that was man made in a Chinese lab funded by democrats.

1	We know little about the omicron variant. Probably the labs will adapt their vaccine but in the meantime, the variant that can send frail people to hospital is the delta which is in the majority. Do the booster in the frail as a priority.
1	So whatever vaccine you might receive, it’s much better to be protected.
1	I will cheerfully take whichever of these vaccines I can get ASAP.
1	I got vaccinated! I only had a sore arm for a day or two. No issues otherwise!!
1	refusing the jab for nhs staff in my opion is a failure of duty of care and should be treated as such, unless said staff member has medical exemption
1	Things should be made very hard and annoying for the anti-vaxer
0	STOP LIES ON COVID-19 VACCINES' EFFECTIVENESS TO HEALTH
0	Nah imma wait until it is safer and proven to have no negative side effects
0	Well my wife got the vaccine and now has COVID, the vaccine doesn't work, it's a scam
0	I have a strong immune system that NEVER gets infected and never has to obtain an immune response. I have never gotten nor will I ever get COVID because I am healthy and strong.  I will decline vaccination because I am not frail and unhealthy. Only frail people proselytize vaccines because they are very weak and very unhealthy and are on their way out; they need vaccines in order to survive.
0	"we won't know how safe these vaccines are until we start giving them".  that's some scientific stuff right there
0	The COVID vaccine specifically, I simply don't trust it. I am anti-politics because it's such a circus so I am neither far left nor far right.
1	Anyone not wanting to take a vaccination, you're on your own
0	Vaccines kill, Vaccine Passport kill even more! All murderers will be judged in the near future.
1	Rude how? Facts... I have been listening to the conservative Q nonsense for 5 years now ...we are in the middle of a 5th wave...and when I tried to be civil..in this thread post....I was told to go back to Mexico.(I'm neither Mexican nor do I have any south American heritage)....then I was told to shut up cuz I came from a different country...The people here spinning vaccine & testing conspiracies doesn't deserve civility after 5 years...they deserve the truth...if you don't believe the vaccine works...don't waste time of the doctors or the hospitals ...stay home ...let your immunity cures you...cuz that's what you all believe in ...isn't it?
1	Does anyone know where i can get Moderna second dose
1	Got the J & J shot, then J & J booster. Haven't had covid! Works for me!
0	Those poor children. Wake up parents!
1	Hey, if he is willing to die over the vaccine, that is his choice
0	I refuse to get the vaccine, bc I think that China created the virus as a biochemical weapon to destroy the world & then to control the world.
1	People say “well what did people do before vaccines/antibiotics/pasteurisation?” as if that’s an argument for going natural. They died, Carol. A lot of people died.
1	You are going to be okay. Get vaccinated and save lives.
0	The risk of the vaccine outweighs the risk of covid imo. They admit risk. I have had the 2 jabs.I will not have the booster. I do not want to be yet another statistic or victim.
1	no. Im not from america and i've always known covid vaccines were about keeping you at light symptomps if you get it.
0	A vaccine against something that doesn't exist .... oh dear we are getting desperate
1	75% beats 0% of unvaccinated
0	I'm naturally immunized by having Coronavirus and I don't need additional vaccine that will probably make me sick. That simple. If you are immunized by vaccine you don't need to worry about me the same way I'm not worried about anyone else. My body My choice. 😄
0	It makes no sense how the vaccine saved your partners life when truth be told, he may have experienced the same or less or worse (there's no way to know) without the vaccine. There is no proof that it helps ANYTHING.
0	The vaccine is the actual pandemic we need to stop it
1	A growing body of evidence shows that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the known and potential risks. CDC recommends an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) in most circumstances based on an updated risk-benefit analysis.
0	My risk of getting COVID-19 is low
1	I’m so very fortunate to be in a job/position that allowed for access to the COVID-19 vaccine. I am so thankful and after nearly a year of worry, RELIEVED
1	If your anti vac I don’t wanna see you driving a car, using the internet, or eating cooked meat.
1	Lining up…#BoosterDose
0	Studies are show a negative efficacy for this shot. It’s failing miserably, I want my money and my immune system back. Where can I get my refund?
0	They are experimental vaccines, and people don’t want to be guinea pigs to companies with a poor record of integrity.
0	Children's health comes first No to vaccination of children.
1	Oh for God's sake. Get the vaccine you big babies and stop being such huge idiots.
1	It should also be noted that this is only in the context of the timeframe studied. It’s unknown how long this protection will last.
0	How is a vaccinated person more immune than a person who have contracted the disease once and recovered from it?
0	Neither could the first. This vaccine is a fucking joke. A failure. Period.
0	It is unbelievable that billions of people are being vaccinated with an experimental vaccine from a private company that has been condemned dozens of times and is run by a vet
0	People are starting to understand they are being lied to.
0	You always have a chance NOT to take the Covid-19 vaccine. 2. Why? Because I’m not a rat to be used for the medication testing.
0	Have you seen the BBC article with Andrew Marr?   He was Double Vaccinated and got Covid (said it was nasty).  There is a video in which he spoke to a Doctor who said - the vaccine does not prevent you getting or spreading Covid.  He also literally said that we would see more covid cases in the coming months and most would be vaccinated people (perhaps he just meant this as so many people are vaccinated - I am not crying conspiracy here) When you posted this video there was no real data on the effectiveness of the vaccines on preventing transmission. They are only just pulling this together and the claim is it is 40-60% less likely you will transmit.  If you are debunking myths it's a little weird that you have given information at a time that seems to have had no backing in evidence...
1	Well, the "enlightened folk" sure are having a fun time in the comments. I'm sure they be having an even better time when they're in mourning (heaven forfend).
0	It's the long-term (unknown) side effects that concern me the most, vaccine long term effects will destroy us.
1	mRNA vaccines are such a genius method, I love it
0	No to poison and dictators
1	To the unvaccinated: Snap out of it, and effing man up! You are pathetic.
0	50 years??? I think your video is full of crap!!! This vaccine for covid just barely came out!! We are just the guinea pigs trying out the new vaccines!!
1	My opinion: if a person chooses not to get vaccinated, they should work really hard to strengthen their immune system: get plenty vitamin D, keep blood pressure and blood sugar levels under control, maintain a healthy weight and consider taking zinc supplements and black seed oil. Keep the gut healthy by consuming plenty prebiotics and probiotics.
1	I think this might help end this, it looks like everyone will have a good vaccine doses or will get this variant and have anti bodies, so at least for a while after, most people will have vaccine and anti bodies at same time. No where for next variant to go.
0	TELL US THE LONGTERM SIDE EFFECTS??? OH WAIT YOU CANT!!!
0	Imagine being forced to get a jab that doesn’t protect you or anyone else
0	I have a question. Why do so many of my vaccinated friends appear to have no natural immune system anymore ?
0	By no means all vaccination skeptics are enemies of the constitution.
0	MY SON WONT TALK TO ME BECAUSE I WONT GET VACCINE AND NOW I CANT SEE GRANDsons
0	New strains are caused by all these different vaccines.
1	If they aren’t vaccinated by now, they probably aren’t going to do it, unless someone close to them dies or someone gets long COVID.
1	As an average vaccinated person starts to reduce and clears the viable virus much faster than the average unvaccinated person.
0	Thank you Dr. Robert Malone for standing up with the people against vaccine!! Having a real scientist on our side is double meaningful...
0	Im not going to take it nor do i know anyone who will
1	I’m a Baptist pastor in IL. There is nothing about vaccines in the Bible. I’ve read it cover to cover. Don’t blame God for not wanting to be vaxed. Jesus is for health and healing. I tell my folks to get the shot. Peace.
0	No way. It’s experimental. The MRNA vax that has never been tried before in humans has killed animals it was tested on. Covid is survivable. There are medicines that cure covid if you start them soon enough. I have a strong immune system. There is no way anyone should get this vax unless they are old. Ask yourself— why is the govt pushing it so hard. Do you think seriously they have YOUR best interest at heart? Do some research. And not via google. You may be surprised at the science you will find regarding the virus and the vaccine
0	You can listen to your media your free apps but they will kill you. their advice for vaccines is lies vaccines are killing all. be a ware,, mask kills like vax they don't work your own gas killing u slowly
0	If the vaccine works why have so many people died from COVID that are fully vaccinated?
1	I got the vaccine. It works great.
0	You can have my vaccine if you want it
1	The new bvaccines are new thats why I think they arer more secure and advanced
1	Everything is okay in modesty. Sure Mercury is poisonous, but so is literally everything else att the right amount. Simple.
1	I would not hesitate to take the covid vaccine every year, if necessary.
1	Please stay very safe and stay had home and get your vaccine shot
1	Great  let us vaccinate the world
1	My side effects from vaccines is that I’m alive and doing well.
0	Illegal rule. Citizens have to fight and say: no.
1	I will be happy to take a booster, they need to offer it to those that want it over 80 asap..
0	It's not about a 'virus'! It's about control!
1	If you're in the military, and you're not getting the vaccination, you should be dishonorably discharged.
1	if you are worried about mRNA technology get the Johnson&Johnson vaccine, it uses older proven vaccine technology.
1	Influenza vaccines are highly successful and have an efficacy of around 65%. Get the jab or face the slab.
0	Weird how my wife has the vaccine and has been more sick this year than any other. Myself and my kids don't have the vaccine and we have been fine. We all caught covid and it was no worse then a common cold.
1	Dear world.  If only for your own sake, please go and get vaccinated.  I would hate to know what this illness felt like without this protection, think cold, flu and elephant sitting/ jumping your chest all at the same time…
1	This virus can be stopped only with the vaccine
0	Elites are not taking the vaccines. Neither are the top doctors. They're rolling out the rat vaccine for the masses then they'll make a better one for themselves and a higher price for the mainstream later on when this one ends up "failing".
1	Blood clots and scars on the lungs could of already been there. So that can hardly be used as justification to jab you .
0	I was so healthy before. now my heart has pain and I wake up feeling like I got hit by a truck 7 days later
0	Anyone that thinks this vaccine is a good idea or necessary for everyone to get is a brainwashed zealot.
0	pfizer's not safe for adult, why would it be safe for <5 yr?
1	I teasted positive a week ago by an accident and I didn't have any symptoms, if i haven't took that test I would be carrying virus around without realizing. Btw, I'm vaccinated so that is probably the reason I wasn't feeling sick at all. I really feel like vaccination could end pandemic, virus maybe won't disapear but hospitalization rate would be lower and we would be able to live our lifes normally again. I'm just sad that a lot of people doesn't realize that and doesn't trust science.
1	Since the start of the campaign, the number of deaths in elderly care homes has fallen drastically.
0	Watching this did absolutely nothing to convince me to get vaccinated.
0	We never give a new drug to pregnant women, this is very disturbing. Didnt they learn from Thalidomide?!
1	I took my first shot of Pfizer today
1	This is ridiculous. Millons have already received this vaccine (including myself) without issue. 6 people out of millions is barely a blip and makes it extremely rare.
0	He has no power whatsoever to make me get vaccinated. I can handle losing my job if it comes to that. Sounds like working for a small business will still be in the cards, anyway. Shouldn't be too difficult to find a small business owner who isn't a blue-pilled piece of shit.
1	Young and healthy people can still get very sick from covid. I don't want to take unnecessary risks and will get the vaccine.
0	How can they find a vaccine for this, but not for cancer or aids etc. And also so quickly?!?! Makes me question everything
1	When I was in the army part of my job was to teach our soldiers about biological warfare and why vaccines are mandatory for soldiers. I had a soldier who was an anti-vaxer, hadn't had her children vaccinated. After one of my classes she came up to me with a long list of questions about vaccines, I was not able to answer all of them but what I did was call one of our medics to join the conversation, after that she made an appointment with a doctor on base to get her children vaccinated. Sometimes what it takes is showing the worst case scenarios and then having an open and honest discussion with people.
0	Hasnt been out long enough, fda passed it to quickly, well all know 10 years from now when you see commercials on tv stating " if you got the 1st round covid shot, and now have cancer" or (fill in the blank.)
0	It's all about control
0	They need to pass a bill stating tht if the vaccine hurt you in any way your family should be able to sue💯💯💯💯💯💯
1	And it is not true that vaccines give your children autism and I would personally have a child with autism then a dead kid
1	I'm so glad you all could get vaccinated and that it's providing such good protection vs. COVID.
1	Lets get REAL.Some 98% of the people in hospitals for Covid are NOT Vaccinated.The vaccine works.
0	I wouldn’t let my pet take that vaccination. Lol y’all crazy!
0	This mRNA is totally experimental and should not be pushed.
1	I hope this will open some minds. I don't generally listen to anyone medical except my dr. but I am bombarded by all the misinformation so needed to do some research on my own. Thank you for clarity.
1	I had my first covid vaccine today, one more to go
0	Are you tired of new  mask requirements or other restrictions? Are your vaccinated friends blaming you for the need for them to get a  thirdshot? You can do something about it! Abstain from conspiracy theories, block misinformation, listen to the experts, and get your  vaccine!
0	you lost me when you said immunity with the vaccine, we now know that that is bs , it only protects you , and not as much as they made out.
0	I will never take it
1	People acting like their opinion matters when there’s a wealth of knowledge sitting right next to them. Just get the vaccine already.
0	Since you stated that profit is not one of your motivations...Why will you not share the vaccine technology with other countries?
0	If so safe. Why am I signing a waiver excusing all liability?
1	I got the vaccine in April. The only side effect for me was suddenly I felt better than everyone
1	I am very happy that people have the choice of Vax or no Vax and if they want to get ill and maybe die that too is their right. Unfortunately they are tending to clog up our hospitals and denying innocent third parties operations that they have maybe waited years for. I do not think non vaxers have the right to do that
0	I need to see the receipts!!! And damn it I still got natural immunity
0	i am not going to get it!
0	if you needa get boosters for every year then something aint working simple as that
1	This is the right decision, vaccination is not just a personal choice. It affects society and the people around you. If someone gets sick of covid and ends up in in hospital, guess who has to pay for it? I find it hilarous that people complain about this fairly minor 'violation' of personal freedom, but have no problem with stuff like mandatory military service
0	I think it's interesting that so many medical professionals are refusing to be vaccinated.
0	It's time to rise up. We are the people. We need to take control of the rich and elite and make this world better for everyone.
0	NO not NOW not EVER! I DO NOT CONSENT EVER!!
0	but not the covid vaccine, not the one that has to be forced, not the one that has proven to have dangerous side effects of heart attacks and stokes... Why would if be right and responsible to do that, for a vaccine that has a tiny margin of usefullness?
0	Lmao respect to everybody who ignored and outlived all the scamdemic BS!
0	Pfizer should be held accountable for every child that has heart issues after their clot shots.
1	Had my first dose of Pfizer nearly a week ago. Had quite a sore arm the next day, thankfully the pain only lasted around a day. That was the only side effect I had thankfully.
0	You know our body's can make their own vaccine.
0	Does not sound safe to me!
0	I will never ever take your fucking vaccine. Do USC football game was canceled because 44 members of the team have Covid while 99% of the team is vaccinated.
1	Try to remember that the entire goal of pandemic management is to keep the healthcare system from collapsing! That's just possible with vaccines
1	The death rate is far higher for the un-vaccinated. Get your shots!
0	no vaccine
0	Perfectly timing huh?? any tactic to get you juiced up.
0	DONT TAKE THE POISON!
1	Do what Singapore has done, you are unvaccinated, you pay for all your health care out of pocket. They have universal health care like every other first world order nation has but ours.
0	I've also heard of people having a hard time breathing after getting the shot
0	Dr. S, Please explain.......At 10:19 on the video, Table #2 is displayed with red lines under the #'s of deaths in each category. The sum total of deaths for the Pf and Mod vaccines combined (1157+5143+1202+4434 =11,936); whereas the sum total of the un-vaxed comparison group is 6,660, which is only half the number of deaths as
0	It’s Gene Therapy. ‘Vax’ was all false branding
1	Facts don't lie people. Mask up, get vaccinated 2x, and get your booster. Stay alive and well; your family will thank you for it
0	the vaccination is literally pointless
1	I am thankful I live in a state that believes in Science and requires masks.
0	Yup, everywhere people got the jab people get covid. The jab is the virus!!!! At least its mostly dem cities where this occurs…
0	Mandates and forced inoculations are not socially acceptable. May the word spread far and wide!
1	if you have a learning disability and it has been over 3 months since your second coronavirus vaccine- call your GP for a booster.
0	Oh! Now they say, "we should wait on the long term impact of the jabs!" --- Disturbing.
0	Dont take it!!
0	The answer from me will always be NO.
1	Stringent action like vaccinating people of all categories within the shortest period globally may be more effective to prevent spread 0f the virus.
1	I got the vaccine because I’ve multiple co-morbidities that will make Covid 19 a death sentence.
0	As they should. Those promoting kids vaccines should also VOLUNTEER to be on a list to hold them accountable should these vaccines turn to be harmful ?
1	WHY do we treat the willfully unvaccinated? They should be at the back of the queue for care in every situation. They don’t trust science where the vaccine is concerned, but then want every iota of medical science brought to bear when they get sick.
0	There were zero deaths from Covid. Fake virus. Fake vaccine.
0	What's in the vaccines Joe? The media covers up the disaster side effects they cause. Help the unvaccinated help the children who are innocent.
1	Vaccines prevent hospitalization, death, strain on our hospitals, longer illnesses
0	NOT FDA approved! Injecting anything in the body bypassing systems thousands of years old is experimental & doesn't make it a vaccine, like this gene therapy mass trial. Soft kill bioweapons marketed by billionaire narcissists forcing nature to do their will, never ends well.
0	you won't be 100% immune, it's useless
0	pfizer dont care about you
0	This is opinion not fact. Maher is somewhere correct. There's no proof as of yet that the lessen symptoms or prevent deaths. But he's right that they don't work. And with the shocking amount of damage and deaths these shots have caused, they should be banned.
0	Vaccines are just like cigarettes. We used to think cigarettes were really good for people and helped us. Then we realized how bad they are… Maybe one day we will realize some stuff about vaccines too.
1	When an adult or child needs OXYGEN due to COVID-19 their lungs are damaged. Vaccination is effective in protecting against severe forms in adults and children. Protect yourself
1	Please educate yourself and stop spreading misinformation about the vaccine. It is literally killing people in the USA, who have more people during than any other wealthy country
1	If only they rushed to find vaccines for more diseases.
0	The truth about these vaccines is everywhere. Yet I continue to encounter people who believe that, because I'm unvaxxed, I'm a threat to society and it's all (our) fault. The powers that be have become good at manipulating the masses. Scary really.
1	Yes, absolutely. I will get it when it is available to me given my spot on the priority list.
0	Vaccine passports were ''conspiratorial thinking'' as well. Until that suddenly became, ''it is a neccessary measure''.
0	Glad you're better. I support your right to vaccinate even knowing it may have made you sick. I wouldn't recommend it, but I support your right to pursue your happiness.
1	Over 90% effective. Over 90%! Approve, mass produce, roll it all out and inject this into my veins.
1	I got the COVID vaccine and felt really ill after the second shot. I’d hate to know what would’ve happened if I had been sick for real.
0	I know of 6 different people having liver problems within a month of taking the shot. There must be a Tylenol epidemic
0	Met a 25 yo yesterday whose company paid him $2000 to get the vaccine.  Informed consent at its finest.
0	This is great news. And I read that people develop quite a high level of immunity 10 days after the first jab so soon we will have hundreds of thousands of our most vulnerable people who will avoid the worst effects of covid should they catch it.
0	What's going in America is the result of OVER-VAXXING people which reboot & ramp up the Covid & Flu infection rates following each jab for a vicious cycle as people drop off the map along the way. Then, it's onto serving People costly monopolized Covid pills as the antidote on the other hand for their side-effects or symptoms. It will take a world of people to insist on stopping this madness (since Covid will Never Be Eradicated). People are not up for being abused & all. Warp-Speed Drugs are allow so many to capitalize or get-rich off of all this. They are taking advantage of the Obamacare Medical insurance Policy to milk taxpayers $$ and Federal $$$ for all its worth (even if that comes at the expense of harming People's businesses, jobs; lives, health or immune system).
1	Superspreader event. These people are nuts.
1	I got the vaccine, but I understand why people are like "why should we get a rushed vaccine. And covid has a really high survival rate anyways". Even though it was made pretty quick, it has been thoroughly tested and its safe. The covid 19 vaccine also prevents yo from spreading it. But it is your body so your choice.
0	This was never about health n safety. Its about $$$ and control
1	Unvaccinated people spread COVID to others who are vulnerable and could die because of this.
0	No, not until the most vulnerable children are safe to be present. Not until the children with the highest rates of asthma, blood Pb levels, PFAS exposures, and other environmental injustices that dangerously exacerbate their COVID risk exposure are safe.
0	10 shots to da hed...will do it
1	Excellent ... let’s. Get it in the distribution channel quickly! The more people that get vaccinated the better!
0	I like how people defend a vaccine that has a high failure rate for a virus that has a near 100% survival rate because big pharma has bought a lot of ads and lobbied a bunch of politicians.
1	We don't need more explained videos. We need more vaccines.
0	I lost a female family relative recently. I think vaccine effects are more than 1 in a million.
1	Vaccination is already easing Britain’s Covid epidemic with early data showing it is definitely reducing cases.
0	well said I'm sick of getting pressured into having it I'm not having it my friend dad had it and he died with in 2 months of having it I had other family friends have it and ended up seriously ill from it
1	Yes, vaccines are important & life saving.
0	Because if you are vaccinated, you can’t get, spread or die from Covid? Not sure if you covid nazis have noticed, but the vaccine isn’t really working anymore. The government’s “science” is bullshit & if you use commonsense, you’ll see it. Lol
0	I’m still waiting for any of them to die from COVID. Apparently it’s the greatest pandemic ever, but Hollywood is basically immune. Not one big name celebrity under 60…
1	It's kinda funny that anti-vaxxers are usually people who have limited brain power.
1	Tested positive the day of my induction day with baby #3. That previous Sunday came down with nasty cold congestion and a little shortness of breath. Had dangerously low iron too which also contributed to my shortness of breath too was really scared. Wore a mask at home around my newborn and other 2 kids and husband. Husband was sick too. Congestion cough loss of taste and smell but we survived and kids were ok. Scary stuff. I have vaccines so lucky but still scary because lots of unknown with Covid and everyone is so different.
0	Its predicted, once d vaccine is in d market China will come out with a vaccine
0	I ain't taking no vaccine if I don't know what's in it.
1	If you are scared by your health and you want to vaccinate, do it and do not warry about contraindications.
0	I'm such a Humanitarian that someone else can have my dose of death.
1	I'm vaccinated and boosted and so is my family. Thank you Mr. President for helping everyone have access.
1	I have had both vaccines thank you to the scientists
1	this is actually pretty amazing. That means if you actually get infected(chance of infection is 1/20th of non-vaccinated)you have much better chances of not getting severely sick.
0	The covid test still needs to be proven. The vaccinated who get covid must be questioning the shot by now. After 5-6 months you're technically unvaccinated.
1	It just horrifies me that most modern vaccine skepticism is based on lies that vaccines will lead to ASD"
1	A high vaccination rate means that individual pathogens can be eliminated regionally and eventually eradicated worldwide.
0	Unknown long term safety data means she doesn’t know how the jibby jab will affect her body in years to come
0	I've had Omicron, it was very mild. Every day I am glad I steered clear of the so-called vaccines. Covid I couldn't avoid, blood clots and unknown long-term side-effects I could.
1	when 90% of the Covid hospitalizations are unvaccinated, thats dead solid proof the vaccines are in fact saving people. Theres the odd case who was vaxxed, however 90% is overwhelming proof
0	Stay strong my brothers! No vaccine
1	Pfizer best vaccine...
1	it’s not vaccines that will stop the pandemic, it’s vaccination
1	Hot take. The vaccine should be mandatory. Considering the vaccine is free and available
1	Getting a COVID-19 vaccination is a safer and more dependable way to build immunity to COVID-19 than getting sick with COVID-19.
1	COVID Vaccine update: No side effects apart from standard soreness at the injection site.
1	Why would you listen to a nutcase on the internet instead of proffesional doctors?
1	Amazing how being around more vaccinated people made kids less likely to get infected. Seems like basic common sense to me but here we are.
0	That's brilliant that you're fine after  CovidVaccine. I've had seizures, blackouts, loss of balance, skin irritations, worsening eyesight, menstrual disruption, memory loss, coordination problems, excess tiredness ... Now waiting for MRI brain scan and blood tests.
0	The vaccine does not work. It was approved for Emergency Use ONLY, not approved. The vax companies have ZERO LIABILITY. If you want to stick yourself with 7 more boosters of an experimental drug, that is YOUR business. I'm good with my natural immunity. I had it, it was a bad flu
1	I do support vaccination.  But even I wouldn't expect to be wearing a mask.
1	Because I’ve never had a problem with a vaccine before and I’m well over 50. Furthermore, this one is built on top of longstanding research that shows no reason to distrust it. Finally, The people who say it is safe are far more credible than those who say that it is not.  None of that is a guarantee, but it seems to me that the risk of problems from the vaccine is FAR less than that of the virus, and the statistics are bearing that out.
1	The US has like a surplus of vaccines and are even giving people incentives to get vaccinated, meanwhile in my country people are are trying their hardest to get vaccinated cause of scarcity. What a world we live in.
0	We should all ask ourselves do these Vaccines really work or are they marketing gimmicks? I know numerous people including myself who was vaccinated and still ended up with COVID. Even the COVID tests are not 100% accurate. There is lot of nonsensical theories people are spreading at the same time. Believe in your own body and don’t trust anyone. Pray and take care of yourselves.
1	You can be anti-vax. You just can't lie about the medical facts.
1	People who have attempted suicide and survived say that they had an instant regret immediately after performing the act.  I can tell you that denying the covid vaccination and then contracting covid-19 and being put on a ventilator to save your life is instant regret as well.  The smack of reality will wash away the blood of Jesus in a big hurry.
0	No such thing as "Public Health" there is individual health as every person is different.... also no such thing as one medicine fits all... whats good for you may not be good for me?? I dont want vaccine.
0	I’m glad that they didn’t make it mandatory. No vaccins for us
1	I'm pro vaccine but I'm not interested in a vaccine for SARS-cov-2 if it comes out next year. I'd rather it be out for a year or so in the general public before taking it myself. I just want more testing behind it.
0	Something that is safe shouldn’t be mandatory. Wakeup people
1	I don't give two tugs if I get covid and die. But I refuse to spread the disease to other people, so I got the damn vaccine.
1	I got the vaccine got a nice high from it 0.o
0	I have a question, since 1933 when Influenza was discovered; in the US an average of 55,000 to 95,000/year die from Influenza. So roughly 6-8million have died and yet no vaccine that has ever worked? 89 yrs not 8.9 months like your vaccine. And you trust it?
0	My father was close to getting it today but then changed his mind after hearing his friends and family either fainted, getting sick and having strong pain in their bodies.
0	Imagine a vaccine so safe and effective that people must be threatened to take it.
0	Keep inventing new ways to keep it all going on
0	I feel so vindicated. No jab, healthy living.
1	The vaccines are efficient. They were developed from previous variants and omicron has 10 mutations in the spike protein. Regardless, vaccines are keeping people off ventilators and alive.
0	You seem to be overlooking the T and B cell response that natural infection gives rise to. I hope this video isn't deliberately omitting relevant data to present the political point of view of the creators in a more favourable light.
1	I can’t wait to get this vaccine. Thanks, science!
1	Triple vaccinated, and when there is a Omicron vaccine update from Pfizer or Moderna, I’ll take that too.
0	Children don't need it anyway unless they have underlying medical conditions
0	This vaccine does not prevent you from getting or spreading Covid. God gave me an immune system for a reason. I will take my chances. I’m not saying that people shouldn’t get the vaccine but it should be their choice. For me, it’s a hard pass.
0	The vaccine doesn't even stop the spread of the virus and you can still get sick sith Covid with the vaccine. And just because information doesn't comply with your Goverments Propagandra doesn't make it a "conspiracy theory"
1	People who are up to date on COVID-19 vaccination who travel within the United States do not need to get tested for COVID-19 before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.
0	Don’t risk getting the vaccine
0	It’s so rare, it keeps happening. I’m good with my natural immunity thanks.
0	This is the Great Experiment. We're all experiments in this. And we have no idea what it will affect in a year, or 2 years, or 10 years.
1	If the experts recommend it, yes. I've had that shit once; I don't want it again. To everyone who says no; make sure y'all skip your tetanus boosters as well. No point after all in a booster shot, right?
1	My almost 7 year old is really excited. She has been asking about her shot for months. My 4 year old is also ready to be getting it when she turns 5. My kids, young kids, are eager or at least positive about getting their vaccines. Is it really that hard to get the adults on board too?
0	hopefully they will rid of this vaccine passport bullshit so i can fly hom
1	Actually a lot of the people in my country had the sputnik vaccine and it works pretty well! Even my mom who is a doctor told me its not bad
0	Funny how they find the cure for this covid crap in a very short period of time and yet all scientists, doctors or whatever you name them, they haven’t have had any cure for cancer… read my comments carefully and try and understand every word.. this is just the beginning of it!!!! There’s more to come sooner or later.. be aware.. look around you and see where the world at now?? Refer to the bible that was written before our ancestor it’s been mentioned in the bible that this bad scary things will happened.. we may say now it’s not that bad!!! Maybe today it’s not but tomorrow it will.. the beast will be unleashed soon… heads up!!!!
0	Spread that fear, it causes profits to soar!
0	you do realize the guy who made the vaccine doesn’t even have it and doesn’t think it should be given out, hr literally said it needed more testing
1	I signed up for a vaccine in January. Still waiting for my first shot. I was diagnosed with COVID-19 this week. I wish I could have got my shot before this.
1	so it became way worse just because of those... people... who didn't vaccinate, great -.- (Nothing against people that aren't able to get the vaccine, only against those who chose to not vacciante)
0	it still to early to come to certain medical conclusions about covid and vaccines so you must think twice before getting vaccinated .
0	It's not the needle it's freedom of choice.  No one has the right to force you to inject something into your body.  They're using this plandemic as the great reset which will result in vaccine passports and central bank backed digital currency in which you can kiss many of your freedoms goodbye.  Oh and wait for the nationwidw Internet outage cause that's next.
0	Why I'm for COVID vaccines, but against vaccine mandates.
0	Vaccines should provide a better immune response than a natural infection. If not, centainly reinforced doses are not off the table.
1	Well, to personally answer the question, we just don't know. But all we DO know is that the pandemic is coming to a complete end soon enough with how things are going right now with COVID-19 cases on the decline right now.
0	The AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked to an extremely rare blood-clotting condition called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)
0	I don't trust none of this(WHO),vaccines etc.I will rather die in peace.
0	It is not a vaccine. It does not immunise. It doesn't protect. It's a transmitter and receiver. It screws up the immune system. It triggers cardiac and blood anomalies. It's an experimental magnetic nanotechnology. It kills. It's bad.
0	Have you heard of 37 percent of Americans refusing to take any other vaccine more than 13 months after it became available? Must be a coincidence.
0	Smallpox took 15 years to develop and look how well that worked the old vaccines were good they actually worked a lifetime and side effects were small. These spiked proteins are not safe they cause clots they float in the body snd clump up in blood.
0	Suddenly think of all last year’s first batch of AstraZeneca lab rats. We were such brave souls
1	honestly yes I felt better after 4 days, but quarantined for the full 2 weeks. thank God for vaccines
1	Anyone who doesn't get the vaccine is a threat to our democracy.
1	Feels good to hear someone talking about the mRNA vaccine with the same enthusiasm I felt when I learned about this AWESOME technology. People around me were hesitant because the technology is new, but aren't we using new technologies all the time? Besides, the mechanism behind the mRNA vaccine isn't new at all. I mean, taking advantage of our cell's protein factories is just what viruses do, right? Nothing new there. The only new thing is that some incredibly ingenious people have figured out how WE can teach our own cells to produce a particular protein. Once again, science is just learning to copy things nature has been doing for millions and billons of years, and I'm amazed by the fact that we now can deliver blueprints to our very own cells. Isn't that just mind-boggling in its awesomeness? Forget about hoverboards and teleportation, get your shiny high-tech science-fiction style mRNA shots while you can. The future is now.
0	I would have love to see the stat on how many folks with PhDs won't get the shot. Spoiler: IT IS A LOT!
1	I’m glad I’m vaxxed. I’m home with covid but my symptoms have been almost nonexistent. So much better than what I could be going through.
1	In the two years that this “crisis“ has gone on… I have not had one conversation with anyone on either side of this debate… That have been openly wondering… “Where are the vaccines for the little children?“
1	I’m thankful my covid course has been mild and I owe it all to my God-given natural immunity… … that was primed and ready to go thanks to 3 shots of the widely distributed and extremely safe and effective vaccine.
1	if you get Covid the issues with it are less and you can more likely survive.
1	Vaccines are still being tested, on people. I prefer to wait and see the adverse reactions that can occur over time
0	It's not a vaccine, it's an experimental medical trial in its final phase. This is dangerous disinformation which would get thrown out in a court of law. "Stay safe" yourself matey!
0	HEALTH NUTS THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT HEALTH NUTS THEY TELLING THE COMPLETE TRUTH THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO USE US AS AN EXPERIMENT WERE LAB RATS TO THIS WICKED GOVERNMENT AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT HEALTH NUTS HE'S THE ONE IN SUPPORT OF THIS SHAME ON HIM MAN BECAUSE EVENTUALLY MANY SO MANY WILL DIE BECAUSE OF THIS.
1	Imma take the booster dose and I am happy about it
1	Just got my 2nd Pfizer shot
1	I would recommend it to a lot of people that don’t want to get it and a lot of those people voted for me, frankly
0	Hi Guardian. I took all the necessary vaccines in my life, yet I refuse to take a vaccine that has not been thoroughly tested. Does that make me an anti-vaxxer?  Can you label someone who has already been vaccinated willingly many times, but is being sceptical about a specific vaccine an "Anti-Vaxxer"?
1	I had a relative die from covid recently. They weren't vaccinated. I wish they were.
0	Negative vaccine efficacy look it up
1	I've taken the Vaccine three times in the last 7 months. I always wear a mask when I go out. Why? Because I'm elderly and love my family and those good people who don't wear a mask and don't get vaccinated are the ones who most spread the virus. I'm protecting myself and my family from you if you don't wear a mask or take the vaccine. I'm selfish and don't want you breathing in and out to put a virus I don't want in my body. Of course you don't mean to. And you don't want to. But when you shop you may have natural immunity and not know you carry the virus. You buy something in one aisle and walk away. The virus you breathed out hangs in the air for say, six to ten minutes. Someone else not wearing a mask comes along three minutes after you, and they can't see or smell the virus in the aisle and they breathe it into their body even though they really don't want the virus in their body. You don't know it, but you put the virus in their body. Even being vaccinated three times in 7 months, I still wear a mask and while it is wanting to protect me and my loved ones, I know that two people wearing masks and being vaccinated are the lowest chance of breathing in and out and giving it to others who may miss work, don't want to be sick, and in rare cases die. As a young man, I drove really drunk probably a hundred times. I felt I was sober enough to make it home, and back then the drunk driving law weren't as strict. I never had an accident. But now I realize I could have killed someone else and lived through it myself. There is no way to know if I or you gave the virus to someone who got sick or died. So to protect me and mine from those free not to wear a mask nor get the vaccine, I wear a mask and got the vaccine three times. And I'm still alive and have never been sick with Covid. Two people not wearing masks are the ones who most spread this virus and because of them, it could take ten years for the world to built herd immunity. I'm not morally better than those who don't wear a mask or vaccinate. I'm just being selfish and protecting myself from you people. I lost a good friend of 70 years and a strong Trump supporter who didn't wear a mask last year when I did. He was a good person and a Christian and very politically conservative. The Doctor told his widow that it was not Covid alone that killed my long time friend. It was the combined Covid and his diabetes. I'm sure whoever was healthy but carrying the virus will never know that they are the person who put that evil virus into my friends body causing his premature death. Simply breathing in and out. There is no way to know who it was But it has to be someone carrying the virus and not wearing a mask. No way around that. Even being vaccinated I could still give the virus to someone who doesn't want it in their body. So I still wear a mask. Take care and be safe.
0	Young soccer/football players in the U.K. Have died from heart failure caused by the vaccine. All of them were under 30 and last I checked there was 3 of them out of less than 1000 pro players.
1	So far, no one receiving the vaccine has mysteriously begun to find Bill Gates extremely attractive.
1	This annoys me. I got meningococcal septicaemia when I was younger because a vaccination wasn't available. I had all 4 limbs amputated and if a vaccination had been available at the time I wouldn't have had to go through that.
1	I'm so grateful for vaccines. And so glad that new techniques are making them more effective and faster to make!
0	Cambridge observed that natural immunity lasts 13 months and that double vaxxed without a booster have effectively zero protection against Omicron. That's science.
1	If you believe vaccines are unsafe in any shape or form you are a victim of Propaganda & it has brain washed & manipulated you by exploiting the Liberty we hold dear like Freedom & Choice
0	Same people that made the vaccine have killed millions of people with prescription medication and been fined billions of dollars for deaths and severe side effects. We should blindly trust no one.
1	The COVID 19 mRNA vaccines do improve pregnancy outcomes, meaning if you get COVID 19 and are pregnant you are less likely to die or lose the pregnancy  if you are vaccinated.
1	One patient I saw had her mother hospitalised for covid. She didn't think that covid could be so serious until she saw all these patients on oxygen in hospital. She underestimated the epidemic because of social networks.  Don't wait until your loved ones are sick.
1	Less than 1% of the people who have gotten the vaccine had bad side effects.
0	5G Powered Graphene Based Nano-Tech in the Pfizer Vaccine
1	#Singapore approves #PfizerBioNTech #VirusVaccine
1	With most of the country vaccinated that should cause Covid to die out in this country.
0	And millions still don't, because people are waking up on this deadly vaccine.
0	Weak dumb People looooove to feel some kind of superiority complex, first it was with the mask now it’s with the vaccine
0	Dont take vaccine
1	I learned as a child that it is always better to learn from others mistakes, than to make them yourself.
1	Yes Moderna or RNA is very effective, I am done with 2 shots already, No side effect whatsoever.
1	Explore reasons for wanting to get vaccinated. They are good.
0	Safe and effective at reducing the population for Bill Gates, AND making Bill Gates more money. He is a smart man :)
0	Stop damaging our healthy immune systems.
0	we worried about COVID-19 vaccine side effects.
1	I took the Vaccine
1	Want to end COVID-19 restrictions? It’s simple — just get vaccinated
1	I got my vaccine last year on November. And then I was fully Vaccinated. Yes I did got somewhat sick but it got better again. Same with the second one. But it sucks that I end up getting covid because of my brother who got it from work. but he didn't get vaccine.. he had it worse.. and am surprised he still alive.. me and my daughter is fully Vaccinated. But we end up getting covid. Ya I didn't get sick I did get medication and my daughter got slight sick but not dangerous. it's been hard for the both of us.. but we are staying home. People should be Vaccinated.. it well save your life..
0	South Africa had a low vax rate and went through Omni just fine. Vax was good for Alpha and Delta, but doesn't seem useful or necessary for Omni.
0	The poor will survive because they did not get the pure poison injected into their healthy veins.
0	This is why I don't watch the news or read the newspapers. I allowed myself be be vaccinated out of fear. What your describing here is very true and very dangerous to those who aren't aware of this. I am now aware. Thanks for bringing this to the forefront.
1	It is astounding how many of the commenters rely on lies and refuse to accept anything that goes against their bias. Giving them the truth seems almost pointless. This is herd mentality and behavior of cultists.
0	We actually don't know its effects on the next several years, this really frightens me!
1	We could have been over this virus by now, and maybe not had a mutant version if everyone had masked up, stayed home, and gotten vaccinated. We now will probably be fighting this for another year. 600,000 plus dead.
1	Without vaccines you don't have immunity to fight the virus.
1	Y’all I’m so thankful that I’m vaccinated. I’ve been down and out with covid all week, and all I can think about it how much worse it could’ve been because of comorbid disorders I am diagnosed with. It could’ve been so much worse. I’m glad it’s almost over. Whoosh.
1	vaccines should be a no brainer. this is ridiculous
0	Still haven’t gotten the first shot and I don’t plan to
0	Of course it's a basic human right NOT to be forcibly injected with an experimental vaccine.
1	Thank you Thank you Thank you to all of the scientists who worked on the development of the vaccine for COVID-19. Tâ€
1	My best friend’s sister-in-law died last night from COVID. She was a devout Trump fan and refused to get vaccinated. Wake up people.
1	So glad many more Americans are willing to get vaccinated and get their children vaccinated. The only way we come out of this pandemic is through vaccination
1	I got the first vaccine to protect myself, but I'm not crazy about the idea of yearly booster shots like we have with flu. If we can get to a point where the virus turns into essentially another "flu" that mostly just older and immunocompromised people need to get vaccinated against, I can live with that.
0	then catching covid also works
1	i love when they think they know more than people who have literally studied this their whole adult life
0	Never took a flu vaccine- never had a flu. Haven't been administered with a covid vaccine- haven't caught covid. Then why me?? I refuse and will stand strong against
0	If something was a cure and actually saved lives, it would NOT be free. Period.
1	the vaccine is finally working
1	Thanks a lot.  I hope this make everybody understand the importance of the vaccine.
1	you can prevent yourself of getting infected
0	The short term side effect of the shot? No thanks. The long term side effects, especially for people like me with autoimmune issues? We dont know!
0	It may be too early to say the vaccines are unsafe but it is too early to say they are safe too. Normally it takes at least a decade to develop a vaccine, and this mRNA vaccines are something totally new to us, so who knows? What do you know? I’d like to wait and see for at least a decade.
0	You mean when you attempt to force People against their will, they will rebel by any means necessary.
0	All I can say with 100% confidence is that I won't be the only one who dies when they come trying to force it at my house
1	What I hate about common sense is that some people might believe there is middle ground to science, when there is not.
1	Boosted and feeling better~
1	well if you get COVID that also has a high mortality rate. Heart disease is still the #1 killer in America. You have a much higher chance of having sudden cardiac arrest in your sleep than dying of the COVID vaccine, which hasn’t been linked to any deaths by the way. People die after getting the flu shot too because of underlying conditions. It just happens.
0	The companies don't have to care about adverse reactions or deaths because they have no liability.
0	Your body does this without a dangerous drug
0	Yes, those "vaccine's" affects can come years later as the Neurosurgeon said.
0	Not vaxxed and I haven’t been to the doctor or hospital in the past 2 years
0	We don't get vaccinated because: 1) recovered; 2) ALL of the risk group in my area are vaccinated. 3) I do not get vaccinated for the general public.
0	Vaccinations are a joke
0	Yeah it is poison, and it takes along time for side effects to go away, along time stay safe.
0	Free vaccine in the parking garage. Does that sound like drug dealers ? first is free. The cost long term is on you. GOVERNMENT DRUG DEALERS HAVE LEGAL IMMUNITY.
1	I am more concern about covid side effects. I take the vaccine gladly.
1	I am having my Pfizer vaccine shot 1 tomorrow this video really made me feel a lot better about it.
1	When the polio vaccine dropped in 1955 people lined up to get it, & we were 2 years away from artificial satellites. Now in 2021 we carry external world-brains in our pockets & there’s robots on Mars and idiots think the COVID vaccine is full of wizard poison.
0	Vaccidents now wrecking roadways with stroked out vaccine takers losing brain function.
0	Whether you like it or not, the COVID vaccine is one of the most dangerous vaccines ever created. It doesn't matter how bad the pandemic is, if you force that vaccine on people and they're injured or killed, that makes you guilty of crimes against humanity.
1	We all got them shots the first opportunity we could
1	The patient on the respirator, Christopher, says his parents got vaccinated and they still got COVID-19. BUT THEY'RE STILL ALIVE. That's the fricken issue - not only are you far less likely to get Covid, you have much milder symptoms. Now his kid has to grow up without a dad.
1	Scientific Data shows that the vaccine does actually protect you, especially from death and the worse symptoms that would hospitalize you, but Conservatives are famously anti-science at this point.
0	It's wierd how inconsistent this is with getting infected with other viruses. But covid you should get vaccinated everytime a new version is created. Screw that. If I die then I die but I'm totally against the vaccine, people still catch it.
0	"For the first time in history the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who refuse to take it."
1	We really need vaccine for stupidity. Many many patients awaiting as you see
0	Even after Pfizer president saying the shots doesn’t work anymore, as if they ever did? Stupldlty goes a long way.
0	If you play with the immune system, you have to expect that it will react differently than desired.
0	Don’t inject your children with the poison.
1	I don’t feel controlled by government when I wear a mask or get #COVID19Vaccine any more than I do wearing a seatbelt, deciding not to drink & drive or stopping at red light. I am vaccinated bc I want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem. The #CommonGood matters!
0	The big bad gov made sure no body will be responsible 4 the side effects of the vaccines, not even the pharmaceutical companies.
0	No one should try to make people loose their job/career not putting chemicals in their body
1	Even cartoons are vaccinated!
1	as someone who got corona before the vaccine was out: i would do anything to have my sense of smell and taste go back to normal. get vaccinated!
1	Sorry it doesn’t work like that.  I have a few family members who are not vaccinated.  They have had Covid several times.  Also they keep giving it to everyone.  It’s just a fact get the vaccine and help yourself and everyone else.
1	2million people in UK believe the world is flat... I am ashamed that I do not do more to help these mentally disadvantaged people. I vow that from this day on, I shall help these poor people. Believing the world is flat is funny but not getting vaccinated because of conspiracy theories is dangerous. We need to save these lemmings!
0	If shot one, two, three, and a booster didn’t work. What would be the point of even taking the first one?
1	Allowing misinformation about a life saving vaccine and causing ppl  not to get vaccinated during a pandemic is harmful. Ppl are literally dying because of it. I know 10 ppl personally who have died in the last 2 months because they refused the vaccine
0	Once vaccinated, you are already in the trap. Keep on vaccinating every 3 months else you will be down.
1	In one sense, if is reasuring that anti-vax movements are not just Americans. The rest of the world also has idiots.
0	In my age group I have a .03% chance of dying from covid without vaccination, however I have a 100% chance of a possible adverse reaction to vaccination.
1	With Delta the hospitals are full of young people who thought they didn't need the vaccine because they are young and healthy. Getting vaccinated is also doing ones part to reduce spread to those who are at higher risk of dying.
1	The hundreds of thousands of vaccinated folks who already caught Covid: No kidding, man. At least the vaccine kept it from killing us. For that we're grateful.
1	Mission completed, thank you Lord, thank you #Moderna - thank you
0	Ask yourself this: How did the human race survive thousands of years of exposure to all sorts of nasty bacteria, germs and viruses before vaccines came about? It's called an immune system.
0	The cover up of all the vaxed soccer players heart attacks is truly astounding.
0	Just sad and unnecessary people giving kids the vaccine.
0	So true! Fuck the vaccine
0	The vaccine DOES NOT provide immunity.  40% of the people hospitalized with COVID, have been vaccinated.
0	The only thing that is not declining with these jabs is the deaths and side effects!
1	You guys pls get the booster!! A 9 person group went ice skating & half got it. The half that didn’t had the booster. My bf got it & gave it to me
0	Screw the vaccines.
0	I had covid even before it was an epidemic, then l had the vaccine and now the booster , and my heart doesn’t feel the same , the air capacity in my lungs has dropped dramatically the pains l get round my heart and in both arms when walking is so bad 💔😭
1	I got Pfizer and I’m doing just fine!! I’ll do my part to protect my self and other people around me ❤️let natural selection take it’s course. RIP
1	Anti-vaxxers complain about COVID being a biological weapon from China, yet refuses to take precaution of protecting themselves from that same "weapon".
1	if we want to end the pandemic we need to donate vaccine doses because vaccines easily helps in covid-19 chain breaking
1	To all the people questioning the long term effects of these vaccines, despite the fact that they went through all the proper FDA clinical trials, did you have the same concern for hydroxychloroquine, which only had a few anecdotal cases to show its effectiveness?
0	Do you think that politicians get stung for real? Poor naive people!
0	“Will take years to develop” yet the 3 shots they convinced people to get was made in months but clearly didn’t work.
1	People who think Coivd vaccines change their DNA should see this as a chance.
0	How about showing how many people who where vaccinated died.
0	I'll never get it because I have a brain
0	Personally I won't “distrust” the COVID-19 vaccine I just wouldn't take it without more data as 1 year is a very short time for a new vaccine to be created. However I think it should be on the market for those who are more concerned about the disease.
1	I’m sorry all the thousands of doctors and scientists in the world don’t have time to come and see you and tell you the vaccines are safe. Consider that they are all a lot smarter than you and they get vaccinated.
0	Vaccines cause autism don’t give them to you’re kids #STOP VACCINES
1	I'm Asian. I live in LA. I will get the vaccine when I think the timing is right.
0	Blood clots on the brain are horrendous injuries
0	Amazing how people like this woman are still believing the medical establishment after everything they’ve been through
1	As someone who was BORN with almost no IGG immunity, vaccinations saved my life.
1	Please give <11 years the option to protect from COVID, especially those in risk
1	We all got vaccinated because we have children that can't get vaccinated and we need to protect them.
0	Rare Immune reaction? Even with JUST as he says 19 deaths?... One is to many! Many families have lost their loved ones over a jab. That is not to take lightly.
1	The vaccine is good for you, don't believe people on the internet saying this is dangerous
1	The end is in sight, many of my coworkers and I are getting our first doses of the #PfizerBioNTech #CovidVaccine toâ€
0	I'm anti-vaccine and im proud to be i regret doing any vaccine
0	Non of what the government says. Once a liar always a liar
1	You all have had around 28 vaccines. If you are military you have had around 87 vaccines. Stop being delusional and get the vaccine. Actually don’t, we need less people consuming our limited resources.
0	give me a break. Everyone i know that has been sick the last 2 months has been vaxxed.
1	Hey, I am no doctor or any of that but those people may have died of something else. Even if they did die of the vaccine, it is just a small minority of them and you'll be very unlikely to die from it. Hey, I took the vaccine and I survived! My 2nd vaccine is today.
0	The long term risks from the shot are greater than covid.
0	bill gates implanting microchips inside people thro vaccines and thereby controlling them somehow
1	Had both Pfizer shots. Barely noticeable symptoms. Glad I got vaccinated !
1	We cant sit back until, every single person will be vaccinated daily.
0	great, another booster, and another after that! the first one didn't work, will the tenth, 20th?
0	My memory is getting SO bad I have no choice but to blame the vaccine
1	I’m in my 30s had it before the vaccine (pretty severe) second time I was fully vaxxed hardly affected me more than a cold .. these people are paying with their lives ️ my age saved me the first time, the vaccine the second
0	If you so confident of your vaccine, WHY ARE YOU SO CONCERNED WITH MY VACCINE STATUS!?!?
0	These vaccines protect you about as much as a tennis racket used as an umbrella.
1	Just got my vaccine today! Feeling so grateful and absolutely no side effects!
0	George Watts Jr , 24 years old, died suddenly a few weeks after a second Pfizer injection on 27 October 2021. 4 months later, the coroner is formal: "the vaccine triggered an 'extremely rare' myocarditis and he is not the only one".
1	They provide high level of protection against severe illness and death, lower protection against infection
0	Okay just some smug guy trying to make people feel small for feeling hesitant or not wanting it. Very reassuring. Basically telling you, you don't have rights. This nasty video is a great reason to consider NOT getting it.
0	My brother couldn't move his arm for 2 days
1	Vaccines protect members of our society with underlying health conditions and those of advanced age from suffering severe cases of COVID19.  We all need to go and get fully vaccinated because it’s our civic responsibility to ensure that we are in good health.
0	vaccines don't shield you completely
0	Boring boring boring.... When is the 6 wave coming I'm looking forward and to hear about the turbo shot
0	That seems to be encouraging news. This is the Oxford vaccine?
0	After my friend had a seizure after getting the second dose I don’t blame anyone for protecting their children
0	The problem with natural immunity is that nobody is making a ton of money from it, vaccine is only a money invention!!!
1	Vaccines are safe, and save lives. Love this shirt, thanks
0	Awww, I was so looking forward to my booster to my booster of a booster shot!
1	Arguing with an anti vaxxer is like playing chess with a pigeon. You may win the game but the pigeon will knock all the pieces off, poop on the chess board, and strut around like it won anyway.
1	I'm sure to each of the anti vaccination idiots commenting here, their body is a temple. They don't smoke, don't drink, don't eat any unhealthy food and have never had any other medication or vaccines.
0	Pfizer needs to crawl back to hell where they came from
1	yay Vaccine
1	Call for an ANTI-anti-vaxxer policy and ban them from hospitals.
1	Doesn’t trust the science, yet runs to an ER if she gets sick. Shocking.
1	Today I had 2nd shot of Pfizer vaccine and I don’t have any side effects
1	Great! I'm willing and ready for my 4th jab. I'm watching people get sick and die daily and still can't figure out why people are choosing sicknesses and death. The same people that aren't vaccinated aren't wearing masks; unbelievable.
0	what he will probably say and what the vaccine supporters will eat up is that the vaccine isn't supposed to prevent infection or stop spread. it's real purpose is to allow you to get covid but not get so sick you go to the hospital. They'll cheer at how well it worked for him.
0	The vaccine made my weiner small!
0	Hats off to those who haven't allowed themselves, or their families, fall victim to the psychopaths behind the plandemic and their needles
1	We can not get everyone in every country in the world vaccinated. So the whole "if we don't get everyone vaccinated we give the virus a chance to mutate" WILL happen even if everyone in the USA is vaccinated.
1	Needles in arms, baby. Git er done....
0	I am a nurse in Canada and I stand alongside these nurses. Theres a reason why we are hesitant. My reason, we are seeing larger groups of people with vaccine side effects that the mainstream media doesnt talk about. The silence on this is disturbing  especially because itz getting worse.
0	Nearly everyone I know has recently gotten sick with covid. Both the vaccinated and unvaccinated.
0	Nooo do not take it yall it could poison your brain and make you sick
0	Parents said they’ll wait and see before deciding how to proceed.
0	If you are vaccinated, aren’t you supposed to be protected so you needn’t worry about the status of others?
1	#BoosterDose get yourself vaccinated with #COVID19 vaccine booster
1	I'm a republican but I believe in the science of modern medicine and I have faith in the science behind the physiology of the human body as well as the science behind the vaccine anti vaxers are just plain stupid ;\
0	In Gibraltar where every single adult is vaccinated cases are on the rise and they're prohibiting public Christmas celebrations - explain that!
0	Moderna's "vaccine" was the first they ever made and they made it in a day. Yeah, no thanks.
0	Something that is safe shouldn’t be mandatory. Wakeup people.
0	That would be a lot better for People's health than this vaccine ever would. But you see they're not interested in your health.
1	If u don’t believe you don’t haveCovid after being diagnosed that’s fine , you can go home and see how it goes
1	I’ve had both my Pfizer vaccines.  I got my second one on the 6th July.
0	NOT TRUE !!!!!!!! Vaccines HOLD DANGEROUS SUBSTANCES !!! SO EHY SHOULD THE ONES GETTING SICK FROM THEM HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYONE ELSE ! WE WILL STAY AWAY FROM ALL YOU ZOMBIES !
1	vaccines have been common place for 100 years. What makes you think the stuff in this one is any different than the other vaccines out there. Same basic stuff
1	I keep reading that mixing vaccinations is good! The mRNA vaccinations seem to be better.
1	if you are vaccinated then you are protected even if exposed to the virus on a plane. just because a corporation doesn't care about your health doesn't make the vaccine pointless
1	A 36 year old unvaccinated Covid patient woke up from a coma with a message for everyone; get vaccinated.
0	What is a computer nerd doing in this video, pretending to be an medical expert? My guess is, because he's the biggest vaccin market manipulator and covid-spreader in the world.
0	I'm hearing that the vaccine causes people to react to radioactive isotopes in MRI's. Is this another anti-vaxx rumour...or?
0	The vax was advertised as PREVENTATIVE here. The story changed when it became obvious it didn't work.
0	"if anything happens to you after taking the vaccine, we are not reponsible: but if you don’t take it, you are irresponsible."
0	If you truly believe that the world is overpopulated...By all means, voluntarily roll up your sleeve and take one for the team and the planet. The world could definitely use more parking spaces!
1	Finally, someone who has the right information on these vaccines and presents it clearly. I do not regret that I took the vaccine!
1	I got the Moderna one and fully vaccinated since March. I didn't have any major side effects and I'm still doing fine
0	They are just baffled we caught on to the fact that the vaccines don't work, and in fact do more damage than we ever dreamed of.
0	I refuse out of spite and spite alone. I believe, at worst, it’s non-effective but I still will refuse simply out of spite.
0	Simply because even though vaccinated a person can still carry and spread the virus. This was explained during rollout and it was also explained that infection after vaccination was expected. Thats why we asked "So what is the point of getting the vaccine in the first place?"
1	The vaccines do work. … It’s tremendously successful.
1	If you don't want masks and school closures, you get the vaccine.
0	Anti-vaxxers are not an extreme movement. My grandmother was an anti vaxxer. She was born in 1910 and never got sick. She never had memory issues, teeth issues, or issues living alone. She died of natural causes at 90. Mychildren will never be vaccinated. They have no allergies, they rarely get sick, and have no neurological issues. My father and aunt have had the measles, mumps, and lived in a farm community with no tetanus shots. Neither of them have never heard of a single death or complication from measles or mumps.
0	More reason not to get experimental shot
1	See, it's really annoying bc people will point to the protests and be like "this is why you can't make the vaccine mandatory, you'll have a revolution," but I really feel like making it mandatory would contain the outcry. Once everyone's been jabbed, they'd forget ab it
1	How are they genuinely saying “no” to someone who has literally gone to school and does this as a career
0	Several people I know who have been vaccinated still ended up getting the virus in the months following 2nd shot and boosters. Not only that, they also had severe discomfort caused by the vaccine itself in the days following inoculation.
1	Got mine three days ago. My arm is super sore though. I couldn't lay on my arm in bed the other night, but it's obviously totally worth it.
1	If we want our lives to go back to normal as soon as possible there us no other quicker way than getting immunities from vaccinations.
0	A few weeks ago, ninety percent of France was vaccinated. At the same time covid cases in France hit all-time record highs. The# vaccine isn’t doing anything. Not to mention the things it could possibly do to your body later. There are plenty of fair reasons not to get one.
1	Studies show that boosting your immunity with a 3rd dose of #COVID19Vaccine helps lower the likelihood of severe symptoms that require hospitalization, intensive care, or that can cause death.
0	I'm not taking it because i don't need it
0	Yeah. Sell some vaccines. Apply psychological blackmail and stories about people that have accepted your false narrative. Sell sell sell.Pretend to fix a health crisis. While helping to create a health crisis.
1	Don’t worry, a new variant is right around the corner
1	Honestly can’t understand how there could be people on my TL who are still unvaccinated…I waited months for a vaccine & was so excited to get it. My daughter, a #Swiftie, is an ICU nurse…I take it very personally!! Please get vaccinated, don’t put it off.
1	How about restricting unvaccinated people from holding office?
1	I just got the Pfizer vaccine and weas feeling a little under the weather before I got it I don't think it was covid so I didnt get tested for it, am I going to be okay or should I be worried that I got the vaccine while feeling tha way ?
1	The article suggests eating in Northern Virginia to avoid mask mandates. Please do not come here. Enjoy some of the world famous cuisine available from one of D.C.'s many food trucks. Love thy neighbors and do not spread contagion.
0	Only 1-5% of all COVID cases require hospitalization in the first place. Sounds like the vaccine makes you weaker.
0	He must be enjoying a great deal of suffering due to side effect of vaccine so he advices other to suffer as well. It is pity that he is still around.
0	They forgot to tell you that the reasons why vaccines were developed during long period of time it was because they needed to be sure about the probability of side effects that can be only evaluated after some considerable time passing.
0	Don't do it!! That's what you need to know.
1	Great technology, great vaccine!
0	Resist! Only together we'll get it! Before I was not agree with right-wing politicians, Republicans and with religious people. I'm a LGBT-person. BUT AFTER the start of COVID restrictions and discussions about vaccine mandates I became a supporter of all conservative people, opposing these radical measures.
0	And I’ll still pass on the pop control shots
1	i got the pfizer vaccine and i’m fully vaccinated. when i got the first one, i just felt sleepy and a little soreness in my arm. when i got the second one, i went on vacation and had a ton of fun at a water park.
1	To prevent covid 19, put on a mask and ask others to wear it too.  For the safety of yourself and your family, make sure to get a COVID vaccine
1	It's selfish not to get vaccinated, putting your health and others at risk..wasting the resources of the health care system when it can be easily prevented. You don't trust the vaccine? You are so ignorant..open your eyes seriously, 4 million vaccinated people in my country and 2 have died from vaccine complications, keep in mind they had underlying health problems
1	We should get vaccinated with both of the doses. Additionally, there is also a need to acknowledge everyone the value of being vaccinated.  Get vaccinated and spread awareness for vaccination.
1	Got my first jab today and somehow immediately decided that now is the time to scare myself to death by exploring  the side effects. By the way, I've had no soreness, no nothing so far. Yay.
0	@Kenan The Fabulous when u plant a seed soon as it cracks open and roots extend its a baby plant but for a baby that would be the umbilical cord the humans source to its first nutrients as well.  No one knows the long term effects of the vaccine but yes ur right the vaccine does effect allot of things we just don’t know exactly what yet u could just wear copper tho 🤓😏😱
0	The COVID VACCINE will Kill you. Fight for the CURE.....
1	I've had both my vaccines and the booster shot and think its important we protect ourselves and others around us!
0	New drugs? What's wrong with existing or old ones?
1	So many people posting who don't understand what a vaccine is or how antibodies work. Get vaccinated!
0	if trump was in, he wouldn’t pay pfizer
0	After my uncle being vaccinated 2months ago he complaining of chest pain stomach kichwa kuendendesha. Vaccines have many side effects.
0	I remember there was some dismissed rumblings about bits of HIV being used in the #CovidVaccine, and now there's suddenly new HIV variants and people testing positive for HIV in increasing numbers? Hmmm... Maybe yet another conspiracy theory becoming conspiracy fact?
0	SO I took it,if I get sick and die,can my family sue the maker???
1	We all got vaccinated without hesitation. It did its job. Covid did hit my family but all minor cases. The vacciness worked.
0	Not much reason to be hesitant about most other known and established vaccines. However, every reason to be hesitant about the covid ones…
0	So glad Omicron was so mild even for non vaxxed people with no prior infections. Californians need to get back to living and our kids need to be unmasked and stop the ridiculous Covid rules at our schools that don't work.
1	We need a universal vaccine otherwise you're not fighting C19 alone but also vaccine snobbery and conspiracy theories thereof.
0	Iow you are taking an experimental drug via injection. This is why President Trump always offered it as a Choice not a dictate. I refuse to get these "vaccines" because I refuse to be a subject and I am not dumb enough to inject myself with unknown substances. Those of you who ate can call the law offices at 3am.....
0	Fuck no! It is something wrong where
1	The unreasonableness of people who refuse to vaccinate actually leads to the health of others being severely affected.
1	We, the jabbed, will suffer the consequences of the non jabbed ones…
1	Get vaccinated. Period. Stop acting like children.
0	The vaccine offers nothing at all, I've had mine,  and me and my daughter nearly died of covid 2 weeks back, so the vaccine is crap.
0	The biggest question is, why are you trying to force something on me I don't want?
1	Antivaccers are in for a nasty surprise when polio makes a return visit.
1	After infection individual illnesses are not the same. Getting vaccinated beforehand will help with sickness from other serious illnesses.
1	This is so sad. There are a lot of "if only's" going on. Please get your vaccinations.
1	Tested positive the 23 of December I got to spend new years with my mom and sister cause they got it too. Yesterday I tested negative, tomorrow will be my last day in quarantine. Go get vaccinated people thanks to that me and my whole family got mild symptoms.
0	"Employer can force an employee to get vaccinated."  So... what happens if the employee is harmed by the vaccine?  Will the employer pay for the employee's medical bills?  I don't think so…
0	people already on their 4th shots....how many fuc#ing shots do you need for something? Give me a break
1	I have had both vaccines thank you to the scientists
0	I will most assuredly not get vaccinated because my government tells me to, and promises in return, I'll be granted freedom. Let's be clear about one thing... no one grants me freedom, for I am a Free Person
0	Not vaccine hesitant... more like vaccine-not-gonna-get-it
0	the difference: the polio vaccine actually worked to prevent people from getting and transmitting polio. unlike the covid "vaccine" that necessitated a change in the definition of "vaccine" in order for it to even be called a "vaccine".
0	Efficacy not proven .. unlike the efficacy of the human immune system, shown by good margin of survival amongst healthy people. Its better get infected than take the shot...
1	Imagine after a century and a so of adminitrating jabs we have a small portion of idiots who think vaccines are evil. Why? because its cool to go against the mainstream apparently
0	I haven't had the jab and I'm fine. I know people who have had three jabs and still got the flu as thats what it really is...
0	no thx it's clearly not stopping anyone from testing positive
1	Kid: When I grow up i want to be- Anti Vaxx Parent: lol
0	Vaccinated people can also contract the virus and pass it on. People who have already had the disease develop better immunity than vaccinated people because having had to fight the real virus makes the immune system stronger.
0	We were pressured into getting the vaccine so my kids could go to school, and I panicked afterwards because I had realized what I had just done. Thankfully my natural healing friends told me just the trick to get all the harmful toxins out!! You cut up a potato and make a necklace out of it, and you wear it until it turns all black from all the toxins!! I swear me and my kids felt so much better after doing this, you have got to try it!!
0	In 2022, vaccination is the act of enforcing unfettered obedience across a population via the withholding of both rights and privileges. Does not necessarily have to include any medical benefit to the subjugated individual.
0	A microchip is begin implanted with the vaccine. Wake up, people!
1	I took vaccine and my wife did had no trouble getting her pregnant definantly not a good form of birth control.
1	I can’t believe in the uk they are showing all these clips of sportsmen falling with heart problems and blaming the vaccine! It’s Covid that causes it. Go get vaccinated you fools
0	My concerns about his advice about these “safe” vaccines. If they are so safe what can we Not sue the manufacturer of them if we suffer side effects or even death?
1	I'll get vaccinated for my parents' sake
0	They don’t work... I don’t believe in any vaccine
0	What about the ones who took the vaccine and died? People also died from taking the vaccine.
1	In other words, God wants us vaccinated, period.
0	They are only called boosters because they BOOST big pharma profit
1	Any doctor who refuses the vaccine should drop the ‘Dr’.
0	Soooooo. Evil injections
1	what a coincidence that i took the vaccine and never got covid! how could this have happened!
0	Vaccines are not working good they are there for #Corrupt elite and #Corrupt biden family make corrupt money w pharma and vaccine companies
0	Natural immunity is nearly as successful and thousands of times safer for the individual.
0	Wow, most media outlets won't mention vaccine side effects. Subbed. Thank you.
1	I got the Johnson and Johnson back in March. So far No issues.
0	Well done Canada. We, the rest of the world should do the same. Your body, your choice, no restrictions. The jab is not a vaccination. It don’t stop you catching it or passing it on. Your choice if you want chemicals or not.
0	They offered it to me when I was pregnant with my son last spring of 2021. Absolutly NOT! Dumb founded they would even suggest it. Made me loose trust in my midwife and provider.
1	The vaccine looks okey, but I am sceptical towards the vaccinepass
0	If your body is trying to fight off bad side effects it can’t be good for you. That’s all I have to say..
0	They are damaging and killing the Children. Is this not your line In the sand? If not what Is??? #VaccineSideEffects #VaccinesWork #vaccineinjuries #vaccineinjured #myocarditis #VaccineDeaths #VaccineDeath #Genocide
0	The boosters will force a more lethal mutation. The vaccine is not good enough.
1	Herd immunity doesn't require vaccinations yes, but it's better it we do achieve herd immunity through vaccines. Also, they have been proven safe.
0	A virus that has a 99.8% survival rate. A vaccine that does not stop transmission or infection and has no long term data. A world where people have been programmed to think anyone unvaccinated is a danger to Society.
1	Please get vaccinated with this or another approved vaccine when possible people, and trust science for goodness sakes.
0	Nobody should be forced to be injected with anything regardless of their type of job. I hope many of them quit their jobs!
0	caught Covid last year, cared for myself at home, recovered & returned to my job.  I have been exposed to known Covid multiple times since then and have never once been re-infected. I will defer the vaccine to someone who wants it. You’re welcome America, I have done my part.
0	I have a question ?? after getting vaccinated ,after 2 years we will die or not
1	The CDC announces that if you are unvaccinated for COVID-19 that you are 97% more likely to die from COVID-19 than people who are vaccinated for COVID-19. So, what good, valid, intelligent, and/or, well-researched reason do you have to not get vaccinated for COVID-19?
0	Fuck you you Nazi fuck. Fuck your vaccine passport
1	Hope this gets U.K. approval soon this is actually a vaccine I would take then hopefully I can go world travelling again.
0	MSM should be held accountable for these Crimes Against Humanity
0	Not vaccinated....never had covid despite my 3 children and my partner (vaccinated) all had covid.
1	That moment when science and technology saved us all !
0	We have immune systems that do the same thing. I would never put that garbage in my body.
0	You can put this vaccine along with all the others - where the monkey puts his nuts - vaccine are all dangerous
1	Anti vaxx should not have access to hospital if they get covid. They chose not to get vaccinated, then they can deal with it AT HOME
1	Do I trust the vaccine yes. Do I think the vaccine is the best thing to sliced bread, no.
0	We have a right to choose !! Feel like they are going to say we can’t go back into society unless we have the vacine
1	I'm sick and tired of being responsible for someone else's fears. I'm not responsible for your health either. If you're worried, wear a mask, social distance or just stay home. Stop pretending you have the right to make me do it for you
1	It's not up to the individuals cause almost all of them have no expertise in that subject and they make bad decisions. Which is why we have scientists. The vaccine significantly decreases death and hospitalisations. Isn't that a good thing?
0	The only thing I'm concerned about is that I'm hearing that people are still getting Covid-19 after getting vaccinated! What's the point of getting the vaccine if you can still get Covid?
1	The unvaccinated are 68X more likely to die of covid than those who have had 3 doses of an MRNA vaccine. Think about it in terms of your salary -- Imagine multiplying what you earn by 68. You'd be a millionaire (likely many times over). Only, with Covid, it's life or death.
0	I never taking it
1	I saw with my own eyes how well the vaccine protected my older two children and how my youngest struggled with COVID and still has lingering fatigue.
1	I keep telling everyone I know to go read up on why this new medical tech is so awesome. It's going to change the world and help develop treatments and cures for other fatal diseases.
1	We need booster shots for other diseases, but they are safe FDA approved those vaccines
1	Such a damn shame that we can't give the vaccines to people that want and need it in different countries. This is infuriating.
1	Yesterday all my family were tested for covid, and were positive. No symptoms, no fever. Everyone in my family got vaccinated.
0	Allow the natural immune system to fight and strive against the disease, instead of vaccine
0	I was sick in covid, now I have natural immunity that’s better than these shots
0	If the vaccine was working so well you wouldn't need to change my mind. Also I am still unvaccinated and I been living my life like normal. Traveled, been to raves, bars, casino's and still haven't caught any t variant of covid. Not saying covid isn't real but I feel for most people it really isn't an issue.
1	Got my first vac today. I have to wait 3 wks for the second vac. Glad I'm getting it done. No more worries
0	An INSANE amount of young healthy athletes suddenly start dropping dead of heart attacks shortly after taking a shot known to cause heart problems. But it's totally unrelated guys.
1	China grants 1st patent to indigenously developed Covid vaccine
0	Where I live it's become mandatory. I'm terrified as I know people who have had vaccine injury and as a diabetic I worry that I might get a bad reaction. There are just so many vaccine injured citizens and mainstream media isnt reporting it and why not?? Knowing too much sometimes makes it more frightening.
1	You know who really should be protesting right now? Healthcare workers, who have had to endure an extended pandemic of the selfish and unvaccinated. But they won't, because they have too much integrity and too many unvaccinated patients on ventilators waiting for them.
0	This is gold. I'm so frustrated lately. I see people getting banned from Twitter and YouTube for factual, investigative journalism that happens to embarrass Democrats, and I turn to outlets like Gab and Win to follow those sources and end up finding a bunch of blathering conspiratards ranting about how the vaccine is poison or the Mark of the Beast or whatever. The entire middle is being ripped out of society. There is nowhere left for sane, moderate conservatives to create and distribute their content to sane, moderate consumers who want to consume and discuss it.
0	Alex jones was right, he said they were planning on mass vaccinations.
1	I got my first covid shot two days ago, it didn't really hurt. It's like if you pinch yourself with your fingernail. Sure they do it fast, but it's better than slow when having a needle being sticked into you.   Also, here is a tip: when getting a shot, try not to tense up your arm or wherever it is supposed to go, it will make the pain worse. (Basically saying, that don't move the specific area or put to much work into it)
1	I will be a first person in the queue to get vaccinated.
1	The virus gave my young sister heart problems. Vaccine doesn’t do anything. You guys are in a fantasy and and panics with you realizing
0	I have paperwork that shows I have the antibodies. Form my doctor/virologist. Works just fine.
0	NSW Govt admitted they know Covid is milder among children, and they generally recover quickly with fluids, rest and panadol. So why are they pushing experimental mRNA covid vaccines for 5-11yo kids if the disease itself is mild?
0	That shot made my baby’s race change! We’re both white! These vaccines are crazy.
0	Thanks to the vaccines my brother was given he woke up today with heart pains, he’s in the hospital right now as he’s missing out on his high school graduation ceremony.
0	Why is no one talking about how to boost your immune system. Work out, eat healthier, and take vitamins. Instead of talking about about the negative why can’t we people get along and talk about the positive like how to get healthier
0	Still waiting for the evidence they need the vaccine at all
1	when stupidity is more contagious than covid, and there's no vaccine.
0	No need for a vaccine i got antibodies
1	A new study from the Netherlands shows that COVID-19 patients who went to the ICU exhibit physical, mental, and cognitive effects after one year. Anyone who trivializes this disease fails to see what may happen with long COVID. More reasons to get vaccinated.
0	Either way your body does this naturally and much more effective without a vaccine
0	SHE BLINDED ME WITH SCIENCE
1	Today day 2 after vaccine Iâ€™m soooo much better after yesterday. The vaccine works! 101 fever down to my normal.
1	I think it's a good thing to take but if you don't want to take it and your ok with the risk then you shouldn't have to take it end of storu if people suffer ok that's their fault if they live happy then great let's all live happy together end the hatred
1	Even if you had a previous infection, and you now get a vaccine. It acts like a booster and it boosts the immune system. Both the antibody response as well as T cell response
0	Well, my friend was bedridden for three days from getting her vaccine. I’ll pass.
1	I had h1n1 aka swine flu and pneumonia in 2014 I got vaccinated after my age group was able to, I lost my uncle earlier this year to COVID-19 and I am saying get vaccinated, don't just do it for you, do it for your kids and your family
1	The pandemic would go away if everyone would shut their TV’s off and not watch the news.
1	3rd shot is no problem….do what I gotta do to stay alive.
1	tedros. I would like to go and get a covid vaccine
0	No thanks. No poison for my children.
1	Pfizer!!! And I feel fine going
1	All antivaxxers are morons
0	I'm aged 18-59 — we were told not to get AstraZeneca
1	The T- and B-cell immunity is all that matters. Same of vaccine-induced adaptive immunity. This is what prevents severe illness.
0	NOBODY knows for sure if the vaccines are safe in the long term. NOBODY.
0	Take that vaccine & shove it !
1	The anti-vaxxers are literally the embodiment of, "I'm sorta a scientist myself" meme.
0	It has never been about health.
0	These nurses are heros. A lot of anti vaccers can now get vacs cards.
1	I got vaccination a day before yesterday and got fever body pain and coughing. Dr prescribed me only paracetamol 2 time a day. Now I feel very better. Stay blessed Go get your vaccine today.
0	It's infinitely painful to witness people's inability to think about this stuff.
1	A widespread vaccine is to allow herd immunity, so he's just endangering people he works and lives with. Bit dumb.
1	Child abuse ! It’s so NOT NEEDED !!!
0	I don’t recommend anyone to get the vaccine. I took both Pfizer first and second doses and my body feels very lazy ever since especially when a wake up I get a bad dizziness everyday and I noticed it’s because of the vaccine plus my body is healthy and I’m 21 years old and I’ve never felt like this before. There’s a 3rd booster or whatever they’re saying but I will never take it. Be careful people
0	I'm a very healthy person, I had never been hospitialized and I was hesitant to get the vaccine, but I travel a lot. I got the vaccine with horrible side effects. I'm out of breathing every time I work out. I regretted getting it.
1	Well, she would rather get multiple injections of Botox on her face and lip fillers than getting the vaccine.
1	I'm old, and have been through a few things like the polio epidemic/pandemic and other flu epidemics and scares.  I considered the speed that this vaccine came to emergency approval, a miracle.  The notion that the system was being worked on for years, gave me hope, so I signed up as soon as I qualified.  I guess I thought everyone would look at it as the same as any other required vaccine.  I think the same people who object to the vaccine, would be the same people complaining if we couldn't get one early and fast.  Depends on who you listen to.
1	Everybody should be forced to get covid-19 vaccine, otherwise it will spread and kill more people and freeze economies.
0	Less vaccination, go for healthy life style, clean environment and good nutrition. More sustainable. The virus will subside. Get the right medicine to cure the disease.
0	It’s not rare! My friend had 2 strokes 30days after this jab. He nearly died. Going through physiotherapy for 4months and only 60% recovered. Couldn’t talk, walk, eat or do anything. Stay away from it!
1	Iam having my booster shot
1	If you have been vaccinated, be sure to get boosted. If you haven't been vaccinated, today is a great day to start. Nobody is going to blame you for starting now, instead, they will be happy for you.
1	I’m boosted to bejaysus Thank God but we also think you Americans are really loud and mad. Do they teach science in America? Lots of love Ireland Xxx
0	Vaccine is not stopping the spread of COVID-19 but it is making some people richer but mostly makings people suffer
0	Does anyone stop and think how absurd it is to think that vaccines are superior? And not only that but that the majority has consumed such absurdity without a pause. Truly incredible times we live in.
1	I sincerely don’t understand why people feel the need to post negative and disrespectful comments. I can only wonder why they keep listening if they disagree with you. I am convinced that some people are just cranky. Thank you, Dr. Christy, for sharing facts and caring about patients.
1	The vaccine is our only way out of this crisis.
1	Pls have these anti vacccers like a incurable disease like give them anthrax and just see how long it takes them to revert back to hospitals
1	Thank you for educating us! Please everyone get vaccinated as soon as it's your turn. It's the least we can do for our loved ones.
0	Pfizer's original vaccine study isn't very compelling.  Approx. 22,000 in each of the vax and placebo groups.  2 covid deaths in placebo group, 1 death in vax group.  Looking at all-cause mortality, at least 20 people in the vax group died, compared to 14 in placebo.
1	I had both shots ..nada zip zero side effects..well..probably nothing but is it normal to eat raw  carrots a lot more now?
0	WHY DO THEY CARE WHETHER PEOPLE ARE VACCINATED?? SHOULDN'T THEY BE HAPPY THAT THEY ARE VACCINATED AND PROTECTED FROM WHATEVER?? LEAVE THEM ALONE IT IS THEIR RIGHTS.
0	Hasn't been enough time for a reliable study
1	Nearly all the ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines are also ingredients in many foods – fats, sugars, and salts. It's not dangerous and I won't hesitate to take the vaccine.
0	Its different this time. I'm with the antivaxxers!!!
1	I'm PRO-vaccine, was vaccinated, healthy, and alive. Go, Doctor Baldwin!!! We're with you!
1	Others:"This water is clean and treated so you can drink it safely!"  Anti: "Naah! Ill just drink directly from a natural sewer!
0	The shots are the rear problem not the solution.  Way to many side effects
0	A jab a month is good as it will clear out the Tv watching gullible rom society.
0	This is wrong. Judge is an idiot. The vaccine doesn’t even stop covid. Everyone I know who gotten the vaccine has still gotten covid.
0	I don't trust Any vaccine where I can't sue the makers if something goes wrong whose going to look after my family !!
1	I got my vaccine and didn’t get anything. They are good.
0	Your own Immunity is the best Vaccine!
1	Science of vaccines. We use them for measles, mumps, whooping cough, polio etc. We are so blessed there is a vaccine for Covid and variants already.
1	Actually it’s effective, just some delusional people that think vaccine prevents you from getting the virus or having a small chance to even die from it when you have prior health problems.
0	All these big pharma wants a piece of the pie
0	The “vaccine” is killing Humans! Over time it will kill many many “vaccinated”
0	If the vaccine it's as effective as they say it is, why "they" are so concerned about the unvaccinated people? Is this makes any sense?
1	Pull up sleeve receive shot go home wait two weeks then get out there and live your life with a greatly reduced chance of getting severely sick or death from covid
1	All of the vaccines prevent serious illness, hospitalizations, and death, which is the most important metric.
1	I honestly found middle ground with this but im more on vaccine side.
0	Imagine a vaccine so safe you have to be threatened to take it, for a disease so deadly you have to be tested to know you have it.
0	GREAT INFORMATION!!! GLAD TO HEAR PEOPLE ARE STANDING THEIR GROUND. This is still America and people have the RIGHT to decide whats best for them and/or their family. My decision was made a long time ago! No shots for me.
1	Luckily the people you know survived. I work in healthcare. Sixteen patients I care for contracted COVID last December. Twelve of them died within a three week period. They were all under the age of 65. If you get sick with COVID, do us all a favor; stay at home and treat yourself. Let medical services go to those who at least tried to prevent becoming hospitalized.
1	Privileged be offered the #PfizerBioNTech vaccine. I would encourage everyone to take it up. Itâ€™ll help protect peoâ€
0	Honestly this proves to me that the politicians are total scumbag criminals because I’ve had much worse. No one needs  vaccines for this
0	If the vaxx isn’t everywhere, tyranny isn’t everywhere
0	I've got multiple family members in the medical field and all of them are constantly dealing with vaccinated people that have horrible side effects
0	Excellent to see! Well done to everyone protesting.
0	Still not interested in the vaccine
0	My main problem with making the COVID vaccine mandatory is the lack of research behind it
1	I will take my shot next saturday, I am not afraid, I trust the scientists and I am sure that we will be out soon
0	Citizens around the world should be working right now on a plan for resistance against any mandatory call for total population vaccination. We need to be ready and willing to go all the way against this insidious crime.
0	"If I had to get 3 vaccines for measles in 9 months (and I still end up getting measles) I'd have some questions"
0	Because this vaccine is the most ineffective vaccine in history and is killing kids and causing heart problems- seeing how you and so many are willing to sacrifice kids to maybe give you a 5% chance at an extra year or two of life and make big Pharma rich-you are the bad guy.
0	US ARMY ARE HAVING SIDE EFFECTS - BUT THE VACCINES ARE SAFE?
0	What about the cdc saying 15000 people have died from these vaccines?
0	Do not consent. Do not comply.
1	since every COVID-19 infection gives the coronavirus a chance to mutate, being vaccinated helps prevent variants.
1	I took my first dose and only feel a minor pain in my arm.
0	It does not prevent death. It does not guarantee that I will not be infected again.
1	The idiot anti-vaxers are the creatures of the success of vaccines. I am a pre-vaccine boomer. So I remember fearing polio. My encyclopedia had a picture of a person in an iron lung and of a boy in underpants receiving water therapy because of polio, and I remember the coming of the polio vaccine. Anti-vaxers didn't have that experience because they always had polio vaccine. I had mumps, measles, and chickenpox with a risk of shingles because we didn't have vaccines for those. They and their children didn't have those diseases because they always had vaccines. So the experience of a vaccine coming in to end a dread disease is alien to them. So they fear vaccines without the experience of being saved by a vaccine.
0	I don't believe and I'm not taking the Vax. Never ever!
0	It is not safe:  SOURCE: DR. MERCOLA  Reports of deaths and serious injuries from the COVID-19 jabs have been mounting with breakneck rapidity. Those who look at the numbers and have some awareness of historical vaccine injury rates agree we’ve never seen anything like it, anywhere in the world. While data can be hard to come by for some countries, the ones we can check reveal deeply troubling patterns.  • United States — As of June 11, 2021, the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) had posted 358,379 adverse events,1 including 5,993 deaths and 29,871 serious injuries. In the 12- to 17-year-old age group, there were 271 serious injuries2 and seven deaths. Among pregnant women, there were 2,136 adverse events, including 707 miscarriages or premature births.3  All of these are bound to be undercounts as, historically, less than 10% of vaccine side effects are reported to VAERS.4 An investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services put it as low as 1%.5,6  Be that as it may, the reported rate of death from COVID-19 shots now exceeds the reported death rate of more than 70 vaccines combined over the past 30 years, and it’s about 500 times deadlier than the seasonal flu vaccine,7 which historically has been the most hazardous.  The COVID shots are also five times more dangerous than the pandemic H1N1 vaccine, which had a 25-per-million severe side effect rate.8,9 Assuming the COVID shots had the same side effect rate, and assuming some 200 million got the vaccine, the estimated number of people suffering a serious side effect would be about 5,000. We’re well past that already, as 35,86410 people have been seriously injured or killed.  Even though there are nearly 6,000 reported deaths in VAERS, this number is likely seriously compromised. I recently interviewed Dr. Vladimir Zelenko, who has treated COVID patients quite successfully, and we discussed the very distinct possibility that everyone who receives the COVID jab may die from complications in the next two to three years.  He personally knows of 28 COVID jab deaths that were not accepted by VAERS. Zelenko suspects the number of deaths may exceed 100,000 already.  Getting the COVID jab immediately places the injected individual in the very high risk of dying from COVID. Most have the false assurance that they are protected, but in reality, they are far more vulnerable and as a result will not take very aggressive proactive measures to avoid dying from pathogenic priming or paradoxical immune enhancement before it is too late.  Please be sure and make a notation in your calendar to review my groundbreaking interview with Zelenko this Sunday, July 4, 2021, which is only three days away. We will review protocols you can use to protect you and your family or those you love, who now regret getting the COVID jab.
1	I'm sympathetic to the people who are skeptical, especially considering that this country doesn't have the best track record when it comes to minorities and medicine, but to ignore how dangerous the virus is and say that the vaccine is unnecessary because "my mom didn't die" is ridiculous.
0	I'm not an "anti-vaxxer" but I'm skeptical about a newly released, expedited, corporate driven, never been before proven methodology vaccine, for a disease we know very little about.
0	The fact that they’re trying THIS hard to convince people to get that shot should scare the hell out of all of you.
0	We already have nature's vaccine
0	I'll have to add this to the list of shots I don't get every year.
1	Got my first shot yesterday. I have a mild fever and body aches and the arm they injected hurts like a sonofabitch, but still better than covid!
0	Not getting it unless my job makes it mandatory.  I'm fine wearing my mask and distancing in public indefinitely, I've made it this long without getting covid im comfortable just continuing like this.
1	How can people be so egoistic and not take the vaccine?
1	When I was in elementary and had an epidemic of dengue fevers in my country, a doctor said to me.  "Prevention is more better that treating diseases" It is true that there is no vaccine for dengue but I still hold the doctor comments about it.
0	Your kids can get hurt by this vaccine
1	The pandemic will drag on until we get kids and Republicans vaccinated, folks.
1	Thank You for taking the time to address this misinformation. I hope and pray that it will change the minds of some of the more gullible people, unfortunately so many people have completely turned their backs on science, and willingly embrace our former President and his “alternate” facts. Again thank you so much. Cheers MBM
1	Let’s go get vaccinated. All vaccines are safe!
0	Hello! I am not super eduated on this topic as I've not taken a biology course in years, however, I am concered about any long-term effects the vaccine can have especially because unlike other vaccines, this vaccine has not had years of research to determine any possible long term effects.
0	I'm unvaccinated, tested over 3 days each week since September and never got a positive result or felt symptoms. And I've been exposed to lots of vaccinated people who got covid and got sick.
1	Get it RIGHT! Just because someone is against mandatory vaccination or are worried about vaccinations does'nt make them an anti-vaxer. Also vaccination clearly will not stop the pandemic as such, though it will stop a lot of people being very sick.
0	My mother in law is fully vaccinated (she's a health professional) and has gotten covid twice now. Explain to me the purpose of the vaccines again?
1	Any substantial side effects are really rare, much less of a risk than covid. Get the vaccine as soon as you can.
0	cautiously optimistic. So cautious tears.
0	Bro i got covid and it was the exact same symptoms as your husband's in October. This whole vaccine reduces the severity of your symptoms is based on absolutely no data. So yeah it's brainwashing.
1	Major medical organizations state that vaccines are safe.
0	one mouse to the other "Hey, did you get your vaccination?"  the other mouse " No way! They are not done with the human trials yet"
1	People keep mentioning the 2 cases of adverse effect in UK but forgot about the thousands of others who were fine after the vaccine.
1	I'm a 60-year-old guy. I belong to one of the population's most at-risk groups. I would probably take vaccine
0	Vaccination is not very effective.
1	It’s hilarious how people think a couple shots is such a hardship
1	So, why does all of this matter?  Because of this chart.  Covid’s IFR in England has fallen steeply since last winter, but that wasn’t by chance, it was [largely] because of vaccines.  In countries with poor vax coverage, Covid will still be far more than twice as lethal as flu.
1	Sad reality in the field, far from the conspiracy theories. Covid is not an infection like any other. Vaccination protects against severe forms of Covid. Misinformation kills.
0	This isn't a cure. Nothing new in this clip. We are still being played like fools.
0	I work in paediatrics and there is a huge increase in teen cardio and neurological referrals coming in and almost every one of those children have been jabbed… It’s abhorrent what is going on here. Must I now see the same in the young children?
0	This vaccine is all about pharmaceutical companies trying to make money!
1	The risk of myocarditis from COVID is 8 times greater than from the vaccines.  Get vaccinated.
0	I love how the pretence by sky news reporting this is to assume that the pharmaceutical companies are pure souls with no bad intentions, as if large deals worth billions of pounds that go into the pockets of their bosses have no bearing on their 'work' lol Don't worry friends, obviously its all for the greater good! whatever that means..
0	Why take a vaccines for a virus that does not exist,,,???
0	Poison is poison...the diffrence is the same
1	We're just making up numbers now...
0	I pucking do not intend to get vaccinated. Wht if my employer force to get vaccinated?
1	Of course it works the current wave has been much less severe in countries with higher vax rates. The rabies vaccine doesn't even prevent rabies, it just gives you more time to get treatment. Its like saying "people still die wearing seatbelts so I'm not wearing them"
1	My first dose was super easy I felt nothing but a sore arm. I get my second in a couple of weeks
0	It’s a scientific breakthrough and if the test results hold up in a large population, will be the dawn of a new age of vaccine manufacture and research.
1	THE COVID19 VACCINE IS IMPORTANT FOR ANY BODY.
0	She needs to prove that it saved anyone. It doesn't prevent anything and people have been hospitalized for severe side effects and some died. This shot is dangerous.
1	In a war there are casualties. But the goal is victory and restoration of peace. We already have the science we need to defeat the virus. Refusing the vaccines accomplishes nothing.
1	I got the vaccine as a team effort for the world.
1	I got boosted and had absolutely no side effects. Its the same as the first two vaccines, you can still get sick for a day. If you’re scared of one day of bad side effects you should be more scared of covid itself.
1	Good for them, making money while saving people.
1	Got my first vaccine(Pfizer) this past thursday, my arm was sore for 2 days, feeling good, hopefully we can end this nightmare (covid)
0	Hey. Go to the real user experience , I got my immune system weakened after 1st dose of vaccine . I am catching flue , tonsillitis , colds faster than ever .
1	I'm a fully vaccinated type 1 diabetic in my 30s, pretty active, etc. I just got over what I think was an omicron infection...it was like a mild to moderate cold. I know several other people who got it, most had a relatively similar experience although one lady had a fever as well. All were young and vaccinated. Hopefully this thing burns through quickly and brings a quick end to this pandemic (ever the optimist lol)
0	Going to try to be the last person on Earth to get it. Reason being reports coming out about people getting sick or dying now from brain hemorrhages.
0	Certainly, COVID-19 vaccines are political, and that has not been true in the past
1	I don't go on dates with anti-vaxxers
1	I did it because of me mom and dad both elderly. Second I did it because I could go to the pub. Was just a matter of time that you could not do a dang thing before it was a fact. Future foresight perhaps. Not shamed of doing it!
1	How did the 20 people you know they had covid if it wasn't for testing? Your point to discredit testing on healthcare workers is discredited by the 20 people you know who underwent covid testing... Anyone taking care of patients must be given the option to vaccinate or leave the jobs.. I don't want my primary care nor nurses in the doctors' office unvaccinated
1	I took my two shots and felt wonderful, invigorated, brimming with vitality.  I will be taking my booster shot just as soon as the bartender gets back from his break
0	This is experimental gene therapy. You're crazy if you let them inject you with this. It's the largest medical trial in history.
1	If you are an anti vaxxer, ask yourself why you have never had small pox
0	I'm not taking a vaccine that's still in the testing phase. I've had covid and symptoms were mild. I now have covid anti bodies. I'm generally fit, healthy and youngish. I am proof many don't need the covid vaccine. I will not allow pharma to get rich off my health.
0	exactly, and that's another big reason why i wont be getting the vaccine and ill sit back and watch as it all unfolds, hahahaha.
0	I will not getting the shot because Vaccine has to be tested for several years to see the side effects before it is released in public
0	I remember a time when parents would tell their kids, “Just SAY NO to Drugs!”
0	Nurse for 16 years not taking this vaccine. I am walking away
1	None of the Worlds Covid Vaccines were ever supposed to prevent infection. Silly miss-reporting on a public health issue like this only serves to help the lunatic fringe and anti Vaxers spread fear and confusion.
0	When the CEO's who made the vaccine won't even take it, then I am going to question it.
0	After these fast releases of the vaccines I am starting to doubt more things about the health services in general. Am I the only one?
0	This is fantastic news. The phase III trials began for this on in the UAE, didn't they?
0	Since the rushed rollout of the untested COVID vaccine • Miscarriages up 300% • Cancers up 300% • Neurological problems up 1000% Neurological problems went from 82,000 annually to 860,000 in one year
0	I just don't understand why the Covid 19 vacation is being pushed so hard
1	Hard to fathom how protesters are opposed to a vaccine that is overwhelming safe and effective to protect their health and their loved ones. Crazy how they want to prolong Covid that will cause illness and death in the Unvaccinated. Get vaxxed and then we can all get back to work
0	Great explanations and putting things into simple terms everyone can understand! I'm still not taking the vaccine tho any time soon
1	Vaccine seems to be such a big deal in some countries, like the US. Vaccine isn´t such a big deal in Sweden, where I live. We get a lot of vaccines as kids like against the whooping couch, chicken-pox, tetanus, mumps, rubella and measles. Swedes also go abroad a lot, and then we get vaccines against hepatit a and b, cholera and Japanese encephalitis for instance, and other ones depending on the destination. In addition to that, in parts of Sweden there is a big risk to get tick-borne encephalitis, which is really serious, so a lot of Swedes get the vaccine against that. There is also a vaccine against shingles, but that is really expensive, so not many are taking that, but the health agency is discussing to perhaps subsidice that one, then I think a lot of people over 50 will get that one. And some also get the vaccine against the yearly flu, especially the elderly and vunerable. The flu vaccine lowers the risk of dying with 40 % in an cardiac arrest for instance. But there is also younger people who get it, just so they won´t infect others, elderly and perhaps people who can´t take vaccines. It´s not a political thing here and I've never met a antivaxxer. I knew a few exist, but we don´t have many religious nuts here in general, and people who believes in all kinds of mumbo jumbo and woo and conspiracy theories.
0	However, the "vaccinated" most definitely can spread the virus. Almost like it doesn't work.
1	Got my first dose today! Can’t deny that I’m anxious but I’m feeling just fine hours later!
1	I would get the vaccination again! With vaccination corona is survivable… saw so many got really sick on intensivecareunit … so stay healthy, do the smart thing, and get vaccination
1	Thank you. I've been trying to tell my family this, and they refuse to listen. I have medical problems and am fully vaccinated.
1	The vaccines do not contain live coronavirus, and you cannot and will not get COVID-19 from getting vaccinated.
0	Fuck these vaccines. I'm so sick of this shit.
1	Anti vaxxers are thickos.
0	Good for those nurses!! It's a shame they had to do that so that people aren't forced to vaccinate
0	If we wait for study results or data, we could probably die !
0	For the first time in history medicines failures are being blamed on those who didn't take it
1	Yeah, it’s funny how numb I am to people dying of Covid now. At this point, people get what they deserve. Don’t vax? Fine, no one outside of your family will feel bad when you get Covid and die.
1	Absolutely, you should have the vaccine ! I’m a Covid Survivor (April 2020) in hospital for 30 days and in ICU 17 days. I’m still considered disabled because of short term memory loss, PTSD, depression, anxiety and several other problems. They didn’t have the vaccine yet! I have since gotten both of them and will get the booster.
0	The room, it's spinning real fast.... cuz of the gayness. Riddle me this flower boys. I'm not vaxd along with many of my peers and none of us have contracted covid, I have family and friends that are current on vax and have had covid multiple times along with negative affects from the shot. One lady i know somehow contracted a 1/100,000,000 blood disease three days after her second booster. Covid will end when we stop listening to the overlords.
1	You're good with the Moderna at around 75%. Not excellent, but decent protection if you're in a high risk area.
0	Don't believe everything you hear on Fake News. I never had the Wuban Flu, because it doesn't exist. #maskoff #mybodymychoice #plandemic
0	if the vaccine protects nobody...then why are 90 percent of the people in the hospitals unvaccinated? Are you ok?
1	Get your shots, wash your hands and avoid strangers.
1	Stat of the Day: Between 2 January and 24 September, the age-adjusted risk of death involving Covid-19 was 32 times greater for unvaccinated people than fully vaccinated individuals. Source: ONS
1	I would rather be a “guinea pig” for the vaccine than be a “guinea pig” for the COVID hospital treatments.
1	My daughter has a severe egg allergy and many vaccines are suspended in a type of egg protein. I strongly believe in vaccines because I have an autoimmune disease and heart condition. So I as a parent took my daughter to a specialist who did all her vaccines in divided dosages and we stayed in the office for 2 hours after each dosage. She is now a healthy 14 year old and has outgrown the egg allergy and has had ALL of her vaccines 🥰
0	My friend put two young men (children) through medical school.  One is an M.D. And one is in medical science. They are now both in their early 50's.  They advised their Mom and Dad to NOT take the vaccine. I might add that both parents had the China virus.  Their children said they do not know the long term effects of the vaccine.  I to am following the advice of their children.  Both the parents and myself are in our late 70's and healthy.  I don't think they would give the same advise to people who are sickly.  But then again they might suggest strict quarantine.   I respect them and will follow the same advise until told differently.
0	Two mice sitting a bar one says to the other “hey you getting that new Covid Vaccine? Other mouse says “hell no they haven’t finished human trials yet!”
0	I’m anti vaccines. All of them. I will undermine confidence in them for good reason.
0	If there’s one thing history has taught us, it’s that we can always trust Politicians, Media, and Big Pharma! Hooray!
1	I'm gonna get the vaccine on the 21st Pray for me..
0	Don't be a lab rat for the eugenicist agenda.
1	Got my first Pfizer dose yesterday at the Philly convention center. No wait time at all but people were flowing in and out so a lot of people were getting vaccinated.
1	I suppose you believe the laughable and hilarious belief that the vaccination installs some sort of micro chip too?
0	Aww, good for him! His body, his choice. That'll really stick it to the libs!
0	Can we see where this going? A life-long reliance on drugs. A psychological need for constant CoViD "jabs". Imagine how much money pharma have made over the past year alone. Just think how powerful it will make them. How transparent does this need to be for people to catch on? Just try, for a second, to see how much of an incentive the money is for pharma to keep this going...
1	While evidence suggests there is some level of immunity for those who previously had COVID, it is not known how long you are protected from getting COVID-19 again.
0	pros. NONE Cons heart issues and long term issues.
1	I will get the vaccine. Better safe than sorry!
1	Nothing is completely certain but in the UK there is the Phase III trial group for the oxford zeneca vaccine with no significant damage and 90% immunity, and the 100,000 dead group. I prefer the odds first group so I had the first vacination on Thursday.
1	Lol people will buy blue ketchup and feed it to their kid without knowing the science because they trust the government on that one, but a vaccine is a no-go God Bless America
0	its a complot of the chinese government to gain world dominance
0	Here is my updated information on the facts and myths about the various COVID-19 vaccines. It makes it easier to deal with one of those anti-vaccine tropes. Let's be clear. All of the data shows that the vaccine is safe and effective.
1	In September, unvaccinated Americans were 14 times more likely to die of COVID-19 than fully vaccinated Americans. That’s the power of vaccination."
0	BUT YOU GET LONG VAXX INSTEAD OR WORSE
1	Vaccinating children ages 5 years and older can help keep them in school and help them safely participate in sports, playdates, and other group activities.
1	Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett. Thank you for the Covid 19 vaccines
1	My doctor told me no time soon because the virus keeps mutating into more contagious variants. Getting vaccinated is our only safeguard preventing serious symptoms and/or death! Much like how our yearly flu shot works! I agree.
0	Explain to me why then Israel, one of the most vaccinated countries against covid, went back into the epidemic?
0	Imagine being forced to get a jab that doesn’t protect you or anyone else
1	Why the fuck are would you promote this guy who is clearly making up numbers? It’s anti-vaxx and its misinformation. You’ll want to de-platform Rogan and 10 minutes later do this. Atrocious.
1	Thank you god
0	So either way you can get it right? Hmm. So the only benefit is “quicker recovery”. Why is it pushed so hard, I’m unvaccinated and had it once and was just tired and a lil nauseous for 3 days
1	So many people on here make it seem like vaccines are the worst thing in the world where people are literally making these vaccines to save lives. I'm all for the freedom of speech and ideas, but a bunch of y'all are stupid.
0	Taking a look at the infection rate here in Germany, all time high, it's obvious that the vaccine needs a little upgrade or that we accept that this virus won't go away. For the sake of everyone. I hope this doesn't come off as insensitive, this whole situation is just genuinely mind boggling to me. Very complex and difficult situation...
1	Tested positive, 5 days of terrible pain... from Jordan🇯🇴. Hope everyone is safe every where. Was about to book for a vaccine after I clear, but now I will wait 3 months. Thanks, Sir.
1	Everytime I hear a anti-vaxxer talk I simply want to die
1	Vaccinated and double boosted! Thank you. Vaccines are the reason I am still alive today!
1	Make the vaccine a preriquisite for priority in hospitals and then watch how the vaccination figures will skyrocket!!
1	Incredible video. Literally just turned me pro vaccine, 100% brother
1	Got my first dose of the Pfizer yesterday. We're on our way!
0	Personally, I won’t be having it yet. In my opinion, this one, for obvious reasons, has been rushed through.
1	Did it! Because I’m not a dickhead, and I could.
0	Covid 19 Vaccine Injuries are in the millions
1	you don’t wanna vaccinate your kid? Okay Karen.
0	Explain to me how we still call this a vaccine, when it neither stops infection, or the spreading of the virus? It's almost like you were PAID to tweet this.
1	It takes a minimum of 14 to 15 years for a drug to get an approval to come into market  There's certain procedures and protocol being followed all over world for a pharmacological dept. To approve a drug  It undergoes a lot of clinical trials and only drugs which are efficient and safe will be approved for use  In the same way covid vaccine went through all the procedures and protocol ,all the clinical trials all these months and has been approved all over world this quick because we are in an emergency situation  So its very safe ,highly preventive of getting covid
1	There is a real pandemic situation. The vaccines are secure, I am not a virus expert but its the only way to end this
0	I just got the 3rd shot, idk im getting tired of needles and the arm pain and feeling sickness from them. I understand that people are dying because of the virus but can we not take so many shots? This is the 4th one in 2 years…
1	it was my turn today to get inoculated against covid. got my first shot today. thank you
1	Will I get another dose if approved for the general public? Of course. Will I get a yearly dose if it comes to that point? Yes. We all have a social responsibility for own health as well as the health of others to make a society like ours function.
0	the jab is the disease; that they just classify as Covid, actually they classify as "long Covid". If it was not the jab, how could they patent it ?.
0	Protective for now. Long term will tell a story if they even acknowledge autoimmune issues. Vaccines are tricky and deceptive.
1	This is great news for the children; however those selfish folks who refuse to get vaccinated have now opened the door to the Delta-Plus variant, which is a new variant that is now circulating in Maryland. Now that Virginia has turned red, the governor may relax restrictions and give this variant an opportunity to circulate more widely. Thanks you, Virginia low-information voters.
1	Ugh my hubs and I woke up Christmas morning sick, got tested thr next day and we were positive. We are both fully vaccinated & boosted and feel if we weren't this thing could have been a whole lot worse. So thankful!
0	i wish people could understand what vaccinations do to your immunity... some people will develop autoimmune issues because of these vaccines, suffer terribly, and wonder why.
1	The vaccine stops the chances of you getting it, reduces the chances of you spreading it, and massively reduces the severity of you do get it. Do you not understand how vaccines work?
1	This is the one I have been waiting for. One and done. No messing around trying to get a second dose.
1	These geniuses saved my life. I cannot say thank you enough. Thank you, science!!!
0	Say whatever you want. But in the end, we will live a healthier life than all of you who choose to inject poison in your body
0	Imagine someone with a syringe knocking your door to inject a mysterious subtance into your bloodstream saying this needle is good for you. That's the type of world we're living in
1	there’s nothing wrong with believing in a conspiracy as long as it doesn’t intend to harm others. Yet trying to convince people to take a chance on their health by denying vaccines all the time and using covid 19 as an excuse to preach their anti vaxxer nonsense is not right at all.
0	The biggest question is, why are you trying to force something on me I don't want?
0	If it's so effective, why all the booster shots?  If it's so safe, why are people having so many bad side effects?
1	The "vaccine" doesnt make you immune. Just ask colin powell.
0	Heros! Sadly they were incarcerated because they were selling FREEDOM aka vaxx card
1	The vaccines are about mitigation! Ignorance is bliss
0	Y'all still doing that,  huh? Lol. Bless your hearts.
1	This is anecdotal but my wife and I both got the vaccine while we were doing IVF. Our thought process was “We’re injecting her with all sorts of stuff to get pregnant, what difference will a vaccine make.” We never saw a positive test during 4 years we tried naturally. But we’re expecting our first in May.
1	This is the first time in history where people are more scared of the vaccine than the actual virus...  omg guys i got the vaccine now im magnetic
0	Ask yourselves this - if these vaccines are so great, why would 70,000 healthcare workers who risked their lives working through Covid in 2020 chose getting fired rather then getting the vaccine? It does make you think (those of you who are still capable of doing so).
1	Just got mine today, Pfizer , no symptoms at all
0	Don’t need a risky vaccine for protection when Ivermectin works
1	why is it people that, people still don't trust vacinating?
1	Vaccines are an incredible thing and I'm grateful that we have them
1	I got Novavax on their phase 3 trials in the USA, happy to have helped!
1	Got the vaccine..very emotional moment..being a healthcare worker .believe in God that gave wisdom to those scientists. Thank you Pysier
0	My Lord, who is writing your check? Every chance you get, you are defending every flavor of vax propaganda or trying dismiss information that 90% of us have never even seen.
0	Why are they pushing it so hard and fast when they don’t know the long term affects of it, you should not take the shot, but wait!
0	I literally juts had the rona for 3 days it seriously was no big freaking deal. No jabbed and now have natural immunity
0	One step closer to ending this nightmare
0	That's extremely positive. The only big logistical issue remaining is the need for a second dose.
0	If the vaccine is so safe then they shouldn't need liability protection
1	Got my first dose yesterday! Looks like we’re finally on the tail end of this
1	Take the vaccines. They are working.
0	Good for you. I have been healthy until I got the vaccine.
0	Regarding vaccines : Why do the PROTECTED need to be PROTECTED from the UNPROTECTED by covertly forcing the UNPROTECTED to use the PROTECTION that did not PROTECT the PROTECTED in the first place?? Why are there so many infections and deaths amongst those vaccinated??
0	Dr Robert Malone, inventor of mRna vaccines, tweeted a study that mentioned the harms from the Pfizer vaccine & the problems with its clinical trials. For this Twitter SUSPENDED his account. Why are we not allowed to discuss the potential harm of overly vaccinating!!
0	How do you encourage them to stay positive? Real answer from Dr. Patel would be: "I don't! I am a fear-monger who is profiting from the vaccine covering masses!"
0	we waiting to see if the COVID-19 vaccine safe.
1	Widespread vaccination for COVID-19 is a critical tool to best protect everyone from COVID-19 and COVID-19 related complications.
1	There should be a bigger HC Award, for not just regular people. Like, when an anti-vax celebrity goes down. Someone who has done maximum damage by spreading their anti-vax BS to a large audience. The radio guys would be good ones, Ben is another one. Sherri Tenpenny, Del Bigtree, RFK Jr., and Bob Sears, Not-Doctor-but-MISTER Andrew Wakefield…
0	because its a lie that these shots make the world safe... consider your country lucky!
1	COVID 19 Booster does. Done.
0	I see why people don't want to get the vaccine, they simply don't trust the people saying it's safe.
0	The vaccine developers will say it's safe, but follow the money. Who makes a profit by pushing vaccines on people?
0	The vaccine is more of a danger to people than the virus Joe why would you supply such bad technology?
0	There are so many people in the USA right now that have accepted a gene therapy or rewritten definition 3 times of what a vaccine should be, how can we have more deaths and more cases with less normal people than we had a year ago!
1	Wearing masks and keeping social distance have been proven effective to prevent airborne infection for over 100 years, since the Spanish flu outbreak in 1918.
0	Be careful of the #COVID19Vaccine, it can change your gene.
1	My 2nd and booster dose gave me a fever. Couldn't sleep and I was in pain for the night but that's just my bodies immune response. After that I felt fine the day after so I'd day it was worth it. Still Covid free for now at least.
1	Dr.Campbell, could you make a video gathering the experiences of people getting the vaccine. I think it would help alleviate anticipatory anxiety!
1	Get vaccinated to get on with our lives.
1	Trained doctor: "The side effects are one in a million" So there is no reason to not getting vaccinated
0	The whole world is sick of being blackmailed and forced into a vaccine more like it.
0	Haven't been injected and no regrets as a result. How many who have taken the needle now regret it, lol
0	Excellent another one I won't be taking, shove it
1	Got my shot a week ago. Waiting two more weeks for the second dose.
0	Department of Public Health has published the ingredients list for the Moderna COVID “Vaccine”, and that data sheet confirms it contains a chemical “SM-102.” The SM-102 Material Safety Data Sheet describes this chemical as “NOT FOR HUMAN OR VETERINARY USE” Extremely TOXIC
0	The vaccine can have life ENDING complications Doctor. I've made my choice.
1	Got my booster 3 days ago. 1st and 2nd shot = Pfizer. Booster = Moderna
1	The US has administered almost 2 million vaccines. Only 8 had serious side effects. 4 required hospitalizations. Everyone has recovered.
0	Just stick around because if the science is right the vaccinated will Unfortunately not be around to long
0	Wait and see what happens to the brains of the vaccinated.
0	Notice how it was mentioned multiple times that they actually don't know if the boosters are effective and they're still doing clinical trials on the boosters. So that's where we come in. They're pushing for us to be part of one big clinical trial...
0	Actually, 0% of Americans or anyone else have gotten the vaccine. Instead, they got a covid shot. Vaccine is supposed to prevent infection
0	I’m UNvaxxed and UNboosted. Was home sick over Thanksgiving. Symptoms were MILD and I’m so grateful my immune system worked as it should. Please tell me what the science says about the safety of these therapies out beyond 450 days. Oh wait that’s right, the science doesn’t know.
1	I am sad for his family, but also sad about all of the wasted resources in the hospital used to try to treat an un-vaccinated person who could have gotten the vaccine for free and saved his own life.
0	If people get jabbed after watching this, they are beyond saving
1	Let’s all personally thank this lady for the mess we are in again. Hospitalizations are at full capacity with Covid patients, again. What more evidence does she need? Thank these unvaccinated folks next time for a real mess.
1	I fought for months with the antivax and now, when I see their hospitalizations, it doesn't make me hot or cold. I just feel sorry for the nursing staff and give them all my support and love. The others, let them eat shit.
0	Vaccination is a choice. We have the right to informed consent.
1	Not vaccinating children is a form of child neglect and those types of parents should have CPS called on them.
1	I wanted my belongings to be safe so me and my belongings will be vaccinated soon.
1	I'm so grateful for vaccines. And so glad that new techniques are making them more effective and faster to make!
0	it is not safe millions have died from it i would never have it covid is a scamdemic it is only the flue 99.9 survive it the vaccine is untested and no one knows the long term effects i have no fear of covid would fear the vaccine even if covid was a killer dying of the flue is not as bad as dying of Auto immune syndrome wich is what this vaccine will do people have been Brainwashed by mainstream media the whole thing was planned in the United nations in October 2019 cold event 201
1	Approaching 700k US deaths from covid, more than the Civil War. So many fools risking a covid infection when there's already proven vaccines widely available that can train their body to fight covid without risking a real covid infection. Also amazing the amount of home "researchers" cherry picking anything they can just to avoid getting vaccinated.
0	They are making us to think its fool proof or a " Magic Potion" . and its NOT
0	They don't want it, because it doesn't prevent infection, and it doesn't prevent spread. It also doesn't last if it ever works at all. The risks outweigh the benefit.
0	there's also studies that show the effectiveness of vaccines against infection drop off to near zero within a few months
1	No excuses! Get the shots! Save lives!
0	I'll pass. Vaccines nowadays are more dangerous than the virus
1	I hate needles more than anything in the entire world (including bees), and I pass out every time I’m near one. That said, I will be getting the vaccine as soon as it’s available to me.
1	The COVID risks are waaaaaay worse than getting the vaccine, come on people it is that simple
0	It's the only vaccine I know of, where once you've had it, you still have to social distance, wear a mask or two, depending on when and who's "science" you must follow, and has had no time to have long time clinical trials to see if side effects surface years down the line!! I'm not letting foreign RNA into my body, just to trigger a defensive response from my DNA, just cos flip flop Fauci says so one month, and then changes his tune the next. No thank you. I'll be responsible, social distance and wear a mask, but come near with a needle, and I won't put up with that, not till five years atleast, when unknown side effects start to surface.
0	Vaccines can affect the nerves of the Brain interesting.. 🤔
1	I literally cried when I got my vaccine from utter happiness.
1	If people keep traveling from country to country it will never end.
1	In a study of 1,228,664 people given the Covid vaccine, 36 people still died from Covid. That is 0.0033%. of those 36 people, 78% had at least 4 underlying health conditions. right now, 99% of Covid deaths are from the unvaccinated. Again, how is the vaccine unsafe?
1	What a wonderful day I have just had my second vaccine Thankyou Sheffield for all your hard work Friendliness and expert care You are all wonderful!!!
0	Japan has added a side effect warning to covid 19 vaccine labels after multiple clinical studies showed risk of possible heart problems.
0	I just don’t want it because I don’t want it. Do I really need a reason other than that?
1	COVID will have a silver lining. Vaccine development is going to advance 10 years. I'd rather get a vaccine than the virus.
1	These comments give me no hope for humanity. You don’t believe the experts, you don’t believe the people actually IN THE HOSPITALS TAKING CARE OF ALL THESE UNVACCINATED PEOPLE, the ones who see it for themselves… the confirmation bias everyone has is absolutely overwhelming. Common sense and the ability to look beyond ourselves and only what directly affects us is completely gone.
1	I am vaccinated, and so is every member of my immediate family.  We believe in science and freedom
0	Isn’t this discrimination?
1	seatbelts aren't a choice, why are vaccines?
1	People say "well what did people do before vaccines?" as if that's an argument for going natural. They died, Carol. A lot of people died.
0	Covid vaccine one of the greatest feats in human history, Lex? Whoah.
0	Sounds impressive, BUT No Thank You!
0	They are not safe for everyone and they do not provide any protection against the virus. This thing is a waste of time. Eat right, exercise, wash your hands, stay hydrated.
0	All of my family members are not vaccinated.  We all got covid . All we experienced was cold symptoms for a few days.  We did not need the vaccine to survive. I have friends who are vaccinated they too got covid they're experience was the same except they risked the side affects of the vaccine
0	no healthy people at all need the vaccine
1	EXACTLY MY OTAKU MAN KNOWS WE ARE NOT ANTI VAXXERS!!
1	If you live in the states, it clearly states pfizer or moderna with booster can stop it. So get freaking vaccinated. And worldwide get people the access.
1	Even Trump himself got the vaccine
1	I did because they are shown to greatly if not perfectly protect us from a deadly virus that both kills and leaves others with long-haul symptoms and scarred internal tissues.
0	These vaccines have never stopped or or significantly reduced transmission, as they never intended to be. Even if it was the case covid is just like regular cold or flu, no big deal.
0	One of our staff, who has had Rona, just had her booster. Went down like a bag of the proverbial. She couldn’t stand, sit and had swollen glands etc.A case of the preventive being worse than the disease.
0	Vaccines have to be kept at minus 70c at one stage. Remember that one
1	After watching this video I found out that several of my family members who are unvaccinated had gotten covid and since then one has died today actually. One other is fighting with pneumonia on oxygen.  It's true this is serious and it's real. I'm praying that people will realize that the vaccine saves lives. 🙏
1	If Hitler comes back from Hell to tell American antivaxxers that vaccines are actually good, what would be the percentage of Antivaxxers getting fully vaccinated?
1	Can't wait to hear my vaccinated California hating coworkers complain about it in the coming days
0	What happened to the JVCI RECONMENDATION NOT VACCINATE CHILDREN HOPE THESE PARENTS DONT LIVE TO REGRET THERE ACTIONS
1	I hope the Austrians wake up to this vaccine fascism. The vaccine do help!
0	Vaccines don’t work!! Period!! Move on with your lives and stop obeying or relying on main stream media!!
1	I really hate how antivaxxers use autism as a fear mongering thing. especially since I'm autistic myself. it sucks to have a group of people use the way I naturally am as a "bad side effect", something that you don't want and should avoid. like, gee thanks, I love having the way I naturally am used as a fear tactic and portrayed as a malevolent disease /s
0	Unbelievable how many brainwashed people there are. Wow, your son reduced his chance of dying (and even long Covid) from almost 0 to almost 0. Great job!
0	At least 75 percent of people I have spoken to say there isn’t any way in hell they are taking it
1	I think if you have ever taken anything from paracetamol or aspirin to smoking or given your kids Calpol and have never questioned what active ingredients are in it but are questioning a Vaccine that is created by the same experts, then you are a hypocrite
1	True story: both my kids have tested positive. And they have also been close to me before they were tested. Both me and my husband have been vaccinated and boostered, and we both are still negative. It definitely works.
0	Why must we use vaccines, it's not 100% approval. We are not sukers/stupid. Please be reasonable. Put your trust in God, not in humans.
0	Let us all pray that whatever harm and damages the covid vaccines will bring to the vaccinees, that there's still be a remnant of medical experts out there who can invent a cure to reverse the negative effect of the vaccine.
1	no one is forcing me, now or ever. I didn’t take the vaccine because I was told too. I took the vaccine because, my granddaughter had to be taken out of school when covid started, she has health issues, I home school her. My son in law her father, has stage 4 lung cancer, 6 people at my church died, we also lost a family member to covid. I want to get rid of covid, just like we got rid of mumps, rubella, polio, and all the other virus, science came up with vaccines, just like they did for covid. Covid will stay, replicate, mutate, till we all get vaccinated. I am not suicidal and I am not a murderer, people who choose to run everywhere without any thought of who’s life they maybe taking is very irresponsible. With freedom comes responsibility for our communities, our families, our friends, and yes even those who are enemies.
0	No I won't get vaccinated. I’ll wait for everyone else and their families to be the guinea pigs and figure out what horrible, long-term diseases result from this rushed out band-aid
1	I love how everyone is so fixated on the long term effects of the vaccine, when they don't even consider the long term effects of being infected with covid.
0	This article is so full of half truths and misinformation it’s too lengthy to write. All the truth about the animal studies which resulted in most of them dying, known adverse reactions, and lack of long term human trials is easily found in the internet. This technology was abandoned in 2012 for these reasons. Irrefutable. Historical fact. VAERS has recorded nearly 14k deaths in the US post vaccinations. These injections are NOT finished science and are NOT safe.
0	The fact that pharmaceutical companies & governments will not accept liability speaks volumes.
1	Make the choice to protect yourself, your family and your neighbors.
0	Covid Mania mass hysteria
1	Thank you WHO For help human on the world.
0	Don't need the Pfizer vaccine..Am good
1	Just get it, theres more harmful crap in all the food we eat.
0	World is suffering from the politicians more than covid-19. Vaccine is created to make companies and politicians reach.
1	its good that people are encouraging other people to take the vaccination :))
1	Once we start pumping out vaccines it will substantially lower the number of deaths. Especially in the at risk populations.
1	I remember being amazed when the COVID-19 vaccine was made so quickly, and after watching this, I am even more amazed by how revolutionary this new way of making vaccines is. An applause to everybody who contributed in making and giving out these wonderful stuff. And thank you for the good video.
0	This article was brought to you by.....Pfizer!
0	This makes me sick, I'm proud for sticking up for themselves instead of being forced to get something that can be harmful to there health
0	I can’t even tell my friends that I don’t want to get vaccinated because they won’t understand and support my decision.
0	A vaccine that doesn't work but changes your dna
1	This is one reason we DO need to focus on vaccinations... It is the single most important thing you could do to protect immunocompromised people like yourself who can't get it. There are other things to talk about for sure, but people in your situation should want everyone else to be vaccinated even if you can't be.
1	Out of millions of vaccinated people, how many have had serious side effects ?  Benefits out weigh the risk.  Very sorry for this man.
1	People with actual higher education in the sciences fully support vaccination.
0	Not the crime against humanity planned demic
0	What the use of getting the injection when you can still get the virus and also transmit it to others
0	I’m more sure of my choice every day - and especially glad I didn’t let myself be talked into getting my kiddos vaxxed.
0	Why do they want us to get vaccines so bad when the vaccines don’t work ? Moderna is making another vaccine for omicron. That means this current vaccine doesn’t work but they still promoting it like it does. The Government and big pharma is going to far y’all!'
0	So that will be the 4th or 5th jab in a year, depending where you live
1	Great interview! Albert has done a great job running Pfizer. Thank you to their scientists for working on the vaccine that has saved so many lives.
0	I would more likely stay safe by keeping up my personal hygiene, sleeping good and eating well, and do some sports. And use herbal ways to heal my body from covid, not vaccine
0	your immune gets destroyed more from the vaccine
1	I love it. Everyone must be vaccinated
0	No vaccine can give you a 100% guarantee. I prefer to naturally strengthen my immunity and not to get sick.
0	Ffs so sick of all these vaccines!!!
0	No more for me I’m done, starting to regret having any
0	Here’s what parents should know DON’T LET THEM DO IT!.
1	Just got the Moderna shot. Nice seeing this animation, knowing what's going on inside my body.
1	Thousands have become disabled or have long term Covid symptoms there is no need to continue this trend. Please get vaccinated if not for you, than for those who are less able to protect themselves.
0	the covid vaccine and its consequences have been a disaster for mankind
0	CDC - You mean the Centers for Distributing Covid/vaccines?
0	Is it weird if this made me cry?
1	I just finished my 2nd fully vaccinated just before today, thank you for your explanation! Now I'm waiting the side effects in Japan. I'm young, so I hope my side effects will not be severe.
1	I had covid in 2020 once. It was like cold I lost my taste but it returned after like a week. I've been healthy throughout my entire life. I'm not vaccinated however I was thinking of getting vaccinated soon as I want to travel.
0	also my housemate here in uk said his wife who works at hospital refused vaccine, for half of old people in care home died after vaccine. I believe her. Why would believe advertising in tv, and all censored news, when someone tells as it is. That f.cking gene therapy clearly states, that long term effects are not known! That is why you sign the risks!!! You can not sue! But that is pointless after you die anyway .......
0	Nope I will not encourage my love ones to get the jab. I love them too much to do that. Why would anyone want to put that crap in there bodies.
0	NURSE WARNS STAY AWAY FROM VAXXED PEOPLE! They have become spreaders of many health issues.
1	Get the damn vaccine
0	A cult leader tells you to not listen to your family, doctor, or your religious upbringing.
1	These anti vaxxers people are living in an “allegory of the cave” type of life.
0	people are still dying from covid even with the shot what good is it actually doing if you have a 50/50 chance you live or die with or without the shot. people are so naive to think the government will give out something free to benefit us. when diabetic medication is EXPENSIVE.
1	Celebrating my second shingles vaccine shot.
0	By declining the vaxx , I am 100% safe from any adverse effects , and also have a 99% survival rate without needing the jabs I have faith in my immune system
1	i urge everyone to receive the vaccine that is made available to you
1	Only a fool person would choose to not get vaccinated!
0	If there is a question this shot is dangerous why take it? The world has gone insane in love with the vaccine for no reason
1	I am not avoiding any COVID vaccinations. I have had both my shots and will have every follow up shot advised by doctors.  I believe it is the duty of every person in society to have these vaccinations. Otherwise we will never get rid of this dangerous disease.
0	Never!!
1	My dad finally went for his first dose, I'm so thankful that he's pulled his head from the sand
0	So the Astra Zeneca vaccine was useless
1	My Sister lost her pregnancy exposed to a child with measles. I had my son vaccinated at every stage, including measles
0	If you look back at vaccine history it is hard to find a case where they did not cause more harm than the disease they were purporting to prevent.
1	You weaken our nation, get vaccinated ffs. Give back.
1	GREAT article. Everyone needs to read this, especially those people who don't trust the vaccine because they think it was developed so fast. Really, it was decades in the making. ALSO, this is a great reason to fund "basic" research; research that doesn't have an immediate or obvious application, but helps understand how things work. Without the basic research in mRNA etc. the vaccine would have taken MUCH longer to develop
1	I got the vaccines, because I was so afraid of getting and passing the virus on to someone older or weaker than me. I would feel so bad if someone else died because of my carelessness. I did whatever it took. And so did my husband and all my children. And we were still taking other precautions.
0	isn’t there covid in the shot
1	Absolutely. I don't want to contract Covid, nor do I want to be spreading it around. I will take the vaccine gladly, as often as needed.
1	only vaccinate those children you plan to keep
0	Mask, and everything should be a choice......not mandated
0	I have two vaccine due to government regulation. Now I get flu almost each month while before I was getting flu once in two year. I feel my immunity got weak.
1	I got my 3 jabs so I and my family and community wouldn’t die from COVID-19. That’s my type of freedom
1	yikes at least you said it's your choice but it's definitely not poison. I'll agree not enough time has passed but vaccines are a crucial part of our life expectancy today and why our children are not paralyzed for life.
0	So ig you’re getting this “Vaccine” that was made in 9-10 months?
1	It's getting more difficult to believe that the high number of #COVID_19 related deaths in #Greece is entirely attributable to a low #vaccination rate.
1	Anyone who has not yet understood that the pandemic is a problem for society as a whole and that the individual is (inevitably) a part of society will now learn it in a different way.
1	Just get your vaccine
1	I had my booster last year in October. I caught the virus last week and had diarrhea, a scratchy throat in the mornings, and a racing heartbeat the previous weekend. No fever. My close family members tested positive, so I assume I also had it. This past Tuesday, I felt normal again and feel great now. Of course, I caught the initial stain back in 2020, but please get the booster, and when you get exposed, you’ll probably not feel a thing.
1	Something like 8 billion doses of the Covid vaccine have been given worldwide. Anyone who says “we don’t know all the side effects” is just being obtuse.
0	You are right vaxy, the vaccines are killing thousands.
1	Thank you for this well-explained video. One question, do you know whether concerns about the impact of the vaccine on male/female fertility are warranted? Thank you again
0	Took both the doses and still got severe covid I'm 32, These vaccines are frauds and doesn't work
0	Well big pharma changed the definition of what a vaccine is, so now anything that’s therapeutic is a vaccine, and big pharma can now make billions
0	They are only in for it for the money
0	Maybe if the people that were supposedly protecting us wasn’t lying so much from the beginning , oh yeah and the the Big Confidence of no long term issues, gtfoh. . One minute it’s” there are no long term effects” next “ we can really say or agree to that due to the fact it’s So New” LOL
1	Easy peasy.  You listen to science and science people who come up with succinct pieces of info like the following ones. In other words, all you have to do is let numbers do the talking. We will do the listening.  Here is a comparison of the approved vaccines made by a hands-on scientist[1] who has been busy with COVID-19 stuff for quite some time now (a very competent person, that is): (shared some links). Although some of these vaccines have not been peer reviewed yet, I think we can safely say that there is a lot of people out there working their tails off to make our lives safer and longer.  And that is what guarantees safe vaccines - within experimental error[2], needless to say.
0	How many kids five and under have gotten severely sick or died from Bogus19?
1	thanks a lot for making this video. im getting my first vaccine on friday and was pretty nervous about the long term affects. feel a lot better about my decision to get vaccinated now.
0	These vaccines are way to rushed to be safe
0	Most health workers are refusing to get vaccinad... Doesn't it rig a bell.. Is there something they know that we don't..?
0	"We don't know what the long term side effects are" why do people have such a big problem with this? She's completely right and the fact companies that make it can't be held accountable for the people who have died from it is disturbing.
1	Would you either take a perfectly safe vaccination to own the sheeple or possibly spread disease what a brave stance from this lil freedom fighter bravo.
1	Get vaccinated
0	The vaccines are absolutely useless and pointless
0	How odd that mandates are being made for "vaccines" that are not really vaccines, not fully tested for the mandatory length of time and to add are now obsolete in the face of the new variants. The govt is forcing its population to take experimental prescription drugs, and drug pushing is actually still a crime!
0	why bother pointing out facts and statistics that contradict the "experts" and the "approved" narrative when they will just be removed for a "violation" of social media policy.
1	The choice is clear get vaccinated and give yourself some hope of survival or resist vaccination and perish without hope.  The call is yours to take.  I lost my brother to this pandemic only because he had his vaccination put off for one or the other reason as though he never was in doubt that he did want to be vaccinated it was just  inexplicable.
1	How to reduce Covid hospitalizations by 97%? Get vaccinated and boosted.
0	As a former research chemist... scientists are usually funded/endorsed by large pharmaceutical companies. Whichever pays the highest is the propaganda they push. That's why I quit the industry
1	Thanks for explaining while also acknowledging that the concerns are understandable. I've been trying to research this, but every article has such a condescending tone. The world is so rife with misinformation and conspiracy theories, it's difficult to know who to trust. Your explanations are easy to understand for me, and I'm someone who has a hard time interpreting the scientific data. I appreciate the info.
1	Protect yourself and get vaccinated
1	i got the shot a week ago and have been having horrible anxiety because I see people say "it's gonna mess up your immune system and kill you" the only pain I've gotten this pass week is my in my chest because of anxiety. thank you for this video, it has calmed my anxiety a bit
0	Vaccines are only death, nothing to worry about then
0	This is criminal, it's coercion.
0	To the all anti-vaxxers. You just haven’t been effected by it or see it to understand
1	if it weren't for anti vaxx nurses I wouldn't be taking a travel post making $4700 a WEEK. Thanks guys
0	I do not trust vaccines, I am not vaxxed. I have friends and family that got sick after vaccine. I also know people that got vaccinated and they are just fine, I am not wishing anyone bad, but is that possible?
1	A single person is statistically “no one.” I’m not minimizing your relative, but people have reactions to vaccines, yes. And vaccines save lives.
1	Some people were going to die from other reasons even if they didn't take the vaccine.
0	Lmao it was all a scam to scare people into taking the jibby jabs
0	I have zero desire to get the vaccine. Zero.
1	Thank you sir,it is very important to know about the vaccine details,by this people can understand vaccine is very important...to all of us..
1	My parents told me I was the reason they got the vaccine, & sent me this long sob text about how they really don’t want it but it’s because I’m passionate about it…come to find out their jobs made it mandatory. Manipulation at its finest.
0	I dont get a flu shot so why would I get this
1	as someone who got the full vaccine and booster, it’s a little off-putting (cold-like symptoms) for about 3 days to a week after getting the shots but after that it’s completely fine. also, i wear my mask whenever i go out and i haven’t gotten covid once
0	Support for Christine Cotton who shows the flaws in the Pfizer vaccine clinical study. It is important to explain how this vaccine, which was initially sold as 95% effective, turned out to be very poor.  As a result, she has become the new target of harassment.
1	You know my stances Nick, it's better to get immunity from vaccination. But I won't deny natural immunity exists
0	Nothing you can do because I'm standing by my decision not to take it. Just that simple.
1	I got my second shot 2 days ago, I hope everyone follows the health recommendations.
1	An anti-masker type is the last person I expect to be telling the truth. Selfish people tell self-serving ‘truths.‘
0	It isn’t safe. It could easily have killed me, because I got DVT after having the vaccine. I won’t have the second vaccine, even when they threaten to put me in prison, which I guess will happen around the middle of September.
0	again why only focussed on vaccines why are you unable to look for alternatives . when the cases go down we don't want your vaccines. we need treatments. focus on our well-being use your time and energy for both. vaccinion is gone it doesn't work any more look at Israel. go and look to communicate early treatments!
1	Thanks Doc, getting my vaccine today. This helped alleviate alot of the concerns I have.  Crazy the amount of anti-vax stuff online lately, really freaked me out.
0	Just identify as “vaccinated “ What are they going to do ? Tell you - your not allowed to believe in something your not ?
1	Thanks "Strong Medicine " Doctor a lot for your simple and informative explanations about Covid vaccine. I am big and loyal viewer of yours videos. Like!!!, Subscribed 🤗
1	Good for them!So glad my employer requires the vaccine. Proud to work somewhere that values it health and safety of their workers
1	we need as many vaccines in development as possible
1	It’s time to start canceling the unvaccinated
1	I love how they say “just look at vaccines like the chickenpox”. Yeah, but the big difference is time. The vaccines for polio and chickenpox have been around for a LONG time and we know what the short and long term side effects are. These new COVID vaccines have NOT been around a long time.
0	The reason this is the first mRNA vaccine is because it had proven unsafe in all of their studies since it’s discovery. I wouldn't risk it.
0	No way in the world will I be getting that stuff put into my body.
1	A success rate of 75% is pretty good. The Flu vaccine, which many of us have regularly without questioning it, is generally only 40 to 60 % effective. I don't hear the DM causing a fuss over that!
1	Thank you for posting this!   I'm a Physician Assistant and had 2 healthy 35 year olds who weren't vaccinated end up in the ICU last week.    Thank you to all the staff in the hospital. Thank you for posting this is a kind way.   Please everyone get vaccinated, for yourself, for your neighbors, for everyone
0	Unless you're in a at risk group or over 60 you're more likely to have a higher risk from the vaccine then covid 19  Remember the problems with previously rushed vaccines Total Misinformation by the creator
0	This is medical experyment the effect will come after 1 year.
0	579 days I've been unvaccinated haven't had a cold haven't been sick dozens of negative tests people get fully vaccinated they say you're fine you won't get it now the Delta variants comes out people vaccinated a dying left and right the covid vaccine was developed for one purpose and one purpose only to kill billion of people like Bill Gates wants. So call me a conspiracy theorist I'm alive and unvaccinated and that's how I'm staying
0	Castro's like "y'all did it with a virus? Genius".
0	The more you try to convice me, the less trust I have.
0	Theses nurses have been saying there has been a lot of cases in the hospital of still born babies and some of them believe it to have relation to these mothers getting the vaccine.
1	I wanted the vaccine. Was terrified while at the drive-through vaccination clinic. I almost had a panic attack. Guy talked me down. I knew it was the right thing to do to end this nightmare. Once the first one was over the second was EASY. Please, get it. Many are scared to get it but it is ok. You can do it! Please.
1	Let's fix this pandemic together! GET THE VACCINE SO WE CAN BE FREE AGAIN
0	I can throw my phone away... I can t throw vaccine away
1	These right wingers r kooks, antivaxxers, flatearthers, and believe the moon landing was stage in Disney studios and who think the moon is made of Swiss cheese
0	Short term benefits long term sufferings... YOUR Choice!!!!!!
1	I love the serendipity of the whole thing. It makes so much more sense than the clap trap I hear from the anti-vax crowd that come across as angry cavemen waving a club and eating raw meat.
1	Just take it!!
1	COVID took a whole lot from me but I am very fortunate to be alive and vaccinated
0	If 1 infection = 1 vaccine what is the point of the vaccine? You have 2 hours
1	And that is wonderful for you, however, the well over half a million who are DEAD can't tell you that is wasn't that bad! And why would the person who was the so called president tell millions not to get the vaccine, however, he made sure that his family was totally vaccinated.
1	They can cut your risk profoundly from severe disease, hospitalization, and death.
1	The vaccine  It's safe because it wasn't rushed
0	Taking the vaccine in exchange for the hope on an easier progression of the illness, is like cutting off your leg to avoid athletes foot!
0	Is it wise for those with a perfectly healthy immune system to get an experimental shot? A shot from a company with no liability to you should anything go wrong?
1	WHO wants to even be friends with anti-vaxxers
1	i like to be vacinted
1	It has already come to this. Hospital capacities are exhausted in many places, and previous surgery schedules can no longer be adhered to. And all this because unvaccinated Corona patients in particular are already occupying the beds.
1	Volunteers of @derasachasauda are distributing free masks and making people aware to prevent the spread of Corona
1	In times like today where covid vaccination has become vital for us as well as for other people's protection. we all will #getvaccinated and encourage others to do the same.
1	I have taken three pfizer shots 😁 Feeling good.
0	I won't be taking anymore vaccines
0	Im not taking the vaccine either.
1	got my second dose of pfizer yesterday! not as bad as i thought
1	Vaccination is necessary, so done with people who are antivaxx
1	Idk if this is really reasonable, on a way it's a bit playing with health Or ! Maybe they will quarantine peoples who haven't get their vaccin
1	Vaccinating children can help protect family members, including siblings who are not eligible for vaccination and family members who may be at increased risk of getting very sick if they are infected.
0	No need for vaccines as football fans no longer need a Covid passport. Hooray .
0	Hello The vaccine does not protect you from getting covid!
0	We don’t have evidence that the vaccines in use in the US (Pfizer or Moderna) prevent transmission.
0	Huh... Get vaccinated ... Get boosted interesting theory. Except you're seeing more people who are getting vaccinated and getting the booster get sick more than those who have not. I haven't gotten any of these shots, I haven't been sick once with covid in the 3 years now with it
1	Vaccines aren’t really about your own health, vaccines are about everyone’s health.
0	VAERS latest report has 9,048 deaths from 'the injection'. Swine flu vaccine halted when there were 25 deaths. WHY IS THE FREAKING WORLD HAS THIS NOT BEEN STOPPED???
1	Let's keep listening to the experts, they have got so much right through all this.
0	They are heroes for forging vax cards. I support their actions.
1	I am not worried for myself, but my brother suffers from an autoimmune disease and can get very sick from covid. I will take the vaccine for his sake.
1	I do wonder why folks who are so "don't force me/my rights" folks don't talk more about alternatives to take instead? I have always found that strange.
1	We owe to our parents and grandparents to protect them by vaccinating.
0	I pray for all vaccinated people not to get blood pressure or even thrombosis
1	I’d trust a person with 8 years of high level medical schooling vs an internet article from an unknown source
1	We need all the support we can get to make people understand why this is necessary and a must
1	It's like being anti-surgery because there's a death rate for every operation.
0	More than a third of the population in the UK are watching the results from this drug experiment unfold.
0	"Pfizer has been a "habitual offender", persistently engaging in illegal and corrupt marketing practices, bribing physicians and suppressing adverse trial results. Since 2002 the company and its subsidiaries have been assessed $3 billion in criminal convictions, civil penalties and jury awards." -NCBI
0	The vaccine isn't slowing the spread
1	I run several companies and all my employee will be vaccinated, everybody should get the vaccine, see yaa!
0	The only thing this vaccine actually vaccinates is common sense
1	The vaccine work. I didn’t want to get it but I know first hand it has protected our family.
1	simple solution... get the vaccine
0	I'm thankful my kids are older. This has gotten crazy vacinating kids
1	It’s just that simple people. Get the vaccine and let’s end this thing.
1	More evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines DO NOT have an impact on male or female fertility. However, a COVID-19 infection does reduce male fertility. More reasons to get the vaccines.
0	It's not safe and you know it. My body my choice.
1	You've made the best argument for the vaccine I've heard yet.
1	I want them to see through me that the vaccine is safe
0	What about the people who got it, got over it and have the antibodies?... Why would you need the vaccine if you already have the antibodies?..
1	Just got my vaccine
1	@Son of a Shepherd How tf do u think antibodies are produced?  Vaccines gives us a harmless version of the virus so that the body can make antibodies in advance to fight the real virus. This is biology 101.
1	As a young adult, I would gladly take this vaccine! It would probably be more effective in someone like me anyways and it's only one shot!
1	This is so hard to watch. My mother died back in December and she didn’t have the option of getting the vaccine, but she would have taken it if it was available. It’s heartbreaking to see these people because they could have prevented if. Yes people are getting sick, but the odds of dying are highly reduced when vaccinated.
1	The numbers are against you, millions are staying healthy with the shots, I'm getting tired of this anti-vaccine bullshit
1	Vaccine does not protect you from covid but it does to have your freedom and protect you from protocols and restrictions
1	NOPE!!! That's not how vaccines work dude. A vaccine provides immunity from a disease. It doesn't only work if everyone gets the vaccine. If you think that way, then you are 100% clueless and not credible
0	The vaccine is not vital to keep you out of hospital when it comes to Omicron!
0	At this point tho, with the virus weakening, I'm probably done with covid vaccines.
0	Man I have to wonder how a medical person can say that these vaccines are ok even thought the vaccines are not tested at all..
0	Honestly, I think I'd rather have covid than guillain-barré syndrome from the vaccine
1	Let’s me guess….FDA approves vaccine faster than any other before.
1	m an Icu nurse and we still have alot of patients like Christopher. It seems like they are getting younger now and they end up dying. When did vaccine get to be a dirty word? I have seen a few people who were vaccinated end up on a ventilator but most are the unvaccinated.  I think a life is more important than arguing about the vaccine. I  have seen rare adverse reactions to the flu shot, like guillane barret,but nothing from the covid vaccine, that I am aware of anyway.
0	Turns out, sending unvaccinated kids into classrooms, leads to the spread of infectious disease. Also: 30-49 year-olds, sort your shit out. Vaccines don't contain 5G nanobots, go and get jabbed.
0	A lot of truckers just had a protest against the vaccine. I'm hoping my fellow truckers stay consistent. I'm going to say no to the company I work for.
0	Adverse effects of vaccines are more serious than covid itself
1	Love how nearly all anti-vaxxers are vaccinated.
1	Time to stop punishing the vaccinated in an attempt to save the unvaccinated. 90% of hospitalizations and deaths are among the unvaccinated.
1	If I have to get the third dose I’ll get it without complaint. I hope others do the same
0	I took the vaccine yesterday and I got the worst migraine of my life today. The night followig the vaccination I felt chills the whole night and was freezing even with two thick hoodies on. I regret taking it so fkn much as I was completely fine before and I never got sick with covid these last 2 years.
1	Vaccines work
1	What is wrong with these people, who can't get a simple little vaccination? Don't they have any cojones? Honestly, get the shot - save your life - save a friend's life - save everyone!
0	I agree,I'd rather rely on my own immunity and my lord who watches over me then be a lab rat,for a experimental jab
1	Im on a blood thinner, like warfarin, had vaccined with no issues.
0	We are ready to face your wrath, we ain't buying your vaccine story, so do what you must
0	They want to use "vaccines" to control us. See through the scam, people!
1	It is not that HARD... Help OTHERS AND GET THE VACCINE...
0	This is reasonable. You are very reasonable. What isn’t reasonable: demanding you to take a non fda approved, new gene editing technology without releasing this data. If it’s truly safe and effective then you won’t need 75 years to release the data. And from the data we’ve seen. It’s not safe or effective. It’s murderous. And it seems that they are just trying to kill as many of us as possible before the truth comes out.
0	“May have less side effects” I thought it was perfectly safe
1	The unvaxxed are still making up their own facts and ignoring all the statistics and scientific data.
0	someone commented "when ignorance stays, intelligence moves on". congrats on the vaccine :)
0	Lmao. The people who drank the Kool Aid and realized it didn't help won't go back for seconds. He's confused about this? If you buy a product, and it doesn't work, why would you buy the accessories? Because they are advertised to make the product work as intended? Nah, should've worked at first. Now you've lost the trust of many who fell for the BS the first time.
1	The most frustrating part for me is that these anti-vaxxers die of covid and their families still don't believe that covid is real. My cousin died of covid and his parents still haven't been vaccinated. They both have covid now. Willful ignorance should be made fun of. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
0	It took less than 5 years of Thalidomide prescriptions before the link of birth defects was discovered. Experimental vaccine with no manufacturer liability, it just shows how gullible the sheep are, I’ll take my chances thanks
0	Oh so the vaccine isn’t working....bummer!
0	Everything you put in your body from pharmakeia is harmful. Side effects just differ from person to person. I will never take any vaccine but for those that do No reason to get a vaccine for a virus with a 99.97% recovery rate.
1	just got my booster! the expansion of the vaccine has been great to see!
1	Further, all of the covid vaccines *HAVE PROVEN* to "prevent" the disease. Keep up man. There have been endless studies, reviews, and literal data you can look at to see how effective it is. People sure seem to do a terrible job "educating themselves" rofl
0	Why should we encourage everyone to get the vaccine? Ben, you’re way off on this one.  Maybe older people, yes, but not younger people and certainly not children.
0	He said vaccine will help reach herd immunity.  So far the articles I have read says that you can still get Covid infection and spread it after you are vaccinated.
1	I trust you 100% sir thank you. People have been telling me I’m gonna die in two years after taking the vaccine a few weeks ago and I have been living with anxiety lately because of it. I trust you and not politicians or people in the comment section on YouTube. My dad is also a doctor and told me basically the same things you mentioned in this video.
1	This is the first time in my life I'm learning how vaccines work. Thank you for making this knowledge so accessible! I'm definetly getting my vaccine.
1	Here's a fact: current death toll in excess of 5.5 million.  Imagine standing over a crowd of 6 million dying people and flipping them off... that's anti-vax, that's anti-mask, that's the real USA.
0	Uh, I say No. Under no condition am I getting the shots. I have the antibodies but even before I got covid I still would never get it. Anyone under age 40 does not need it imo.
0	The government are forcing their citizens to take a vaccination without their voluntary consent, this is a human rights violation at this time
0	There are indicators that those who have taken the poison have destroyed their immune system. They are going to have to take jabs or the new daily pill coming out for 15 months after the last covid strain stops or possibly for the rest of their life. AND THEY CAN'T SUE the drug companies since the drug companies are the only ones with real immunity. How is that for irony?
1	Excellent stuff. I didn't have any major side effects and I'm still doing fine
1	Just imagine where we would be if polititions and pundits, and people in general had behaved like this about the Salk Polio Vaccine. Aka these people who with on farms and regularly with horses whether or not they approve of tetanus vaccine.  How about pertussis, whooping cough. Ever seen your child with that? Probably not because you got the vaccine.  Use your brain.
0	Wrong! Herd immunity is more successful by getting the actual virus.  We do NOT need a shot for a virus with a 99.9% recovery.
1	Life is not proven to be safe. But we just keep pushing on. We have done so since the Dawn of time. Vaccines are here to help us 👍
0	If only there was an organisation in Europe that was created to protect its citizens rights and freedoms
1	I agree with getting vaccinated can help you keep the virus away
0	The vaccine doesn't work. All it does is lessen your severity of infection. If your vaccinated you can still catch it, carry it and spread it. So really what's the point, then every 4 to 5 months you now need a booster. It doesn't work.
0	These are leaky vaccines and at best may reduce the threat of hospitalization, but at what cost? As we continue to see more information come in from countries across the world of which are some of the most vaccinated populations globally, and are now seeing an immense amount of break through cases, shouldn’t we proceed with far greater caution ?
1	praying for a good vaccine soon,, be strong China,
1	I made the choice to get the COVID-19 vaccine because it's safe, it's effective, and because I want to protect my family and my community. That way, all of us together, can finally stop COVID-19, get our country back together and back to work.
1	Life started returning to normal the second I got vaccinated. 2021 was mostly normal and quite entertaining with less people doing all of the activities I enjoy to do. So far, 2022 has been no different. I live in a county with 85% vaccinated so what else can I do?
0	Based off the current data. I have a .02 % chance of dying from covid. I've already had covid. My chance of having a negative effect from the vaccine is .5% it's higher than covid risk. Can anyone logically tell me why I should get the shot.
1	Agree completely. Vaccination is the best way to develop an immunity system. And continue to follow safety protocols
0	It's not a vaccine, it's an experimental medical trial in its final phase. This is dangerous disinformation which would get thrown out in a court of law. "Stay safe" yourself matey!
0	"It's exceedingly rare." Statistically speaking, so is dying from Covid. So his entire point is asinine.
0	I was nervous to get the vaccine but I got it because my school has greatly suggested it and I kinda messed up and promised a teacher I would I got my second dose on the 4th and I felt fine besides some pain and swelling at the injection site, but now I’m starting to get a little feverish and just a bit of chills. Apparently that’s a good thing so 😩pray for me!
1	I got Moderna and feel almost back to myself. I got it in May.
1	anyone and everyone can now be vaccinated. Waiting time zero, risk almost zero. A ride on the highway is umpteen times more dangerous than a Corona vaccination. At least for the vast majority of people.
1	I'm working so many hours because half of my coworkers ended up with covid (get the vaccine ya'll pls) and so I have to manage a store by myself for, well... it's been 3 weeks now... I'm pretty exhaysesd and tired, working 11 hours a day..
1	people who are vaccinated are mostly safe from COVID, yes. But they’re still not affecting only themselves! Why? Well, there’s people who can’t get vaccinated (allergies,issues with immune system etc). Also, there’s a lot of ER rooms completely full of unvaccinated people, because of this other people with urgent issues have to wait which could end badly
0	How can they find a vaccine for this, but not for cancer or aids etc. And also so quickly?!?! Makes me question everything
1	Hello, and thanks for this video! I'm a health care worker and have had all my vaccinations thus far, but have become a vaccine sceptic, due to being bombarded by the anti vaxx narrative. But, also, I must admit, it didn't help my scepticism the way that the government has imposed vaccinations on us so aggressively, I believe it should be a choice, not forced onto us. Anyways, I'm going to finally book my first vaccine shot this week, after seeing your video. I've had enough of the conspiracy theories and all the surrounding bs.
1	Got my COVID booster yesterday. I’m totally fine
0	Oh come on how do you expect your terrified brainwashed sheep to stay in line if you stop saying everyone is going to die of Covid if you don't get an ineffective vaccine!!!!
0	I have many friend unvaccinated that got COVID and are well in their homes and working. they were not vaccinated and do not need a vaccine. it doesn't help much. I think we were misinformed and misguided. Dos COVID exist? I think the cure may be worse then the sickness
1	This is great news! Moderna has donated an impressive number of vaccine doses to Mexico, which will help to combat the COVID pandemic. Thank you, Moderna, for your generosity!
1	In the mRNA vaccine, the mRNA sequence representing only a small fragment of the SARS-CoV-2 protein is delivered to cells. This fragment when translated into a protein is harmless but sufficient to be recognized by your immune system.
1	The COVID-19 vaccines are 95% effective in preventing severe disease and death – that is even more effective than the annual flu vaccine.
1	"Tell me you didn't watch the video without telling me you didn't watch the video." Imagine parroting anti-vaxx rhetoric that is debunked in the video you are commenting on.
0	I know MANY vaccinated people who have had covid.
0	Dont take it! People need to fight forcing this.
1	I got my vaccine 2 days ago!!!
1	Get vaccinated pleas because there are some people that cannot and we need to do it for them.
1	If they get sick I hope they learn their lesson and If they die then hopefully their Facebook group with their Karen’s can learn from it as well
1	The booster really seems to help.
1	Pro athletes are not dropping dead, because of the covid 19 vaccine.
0	When the CEO's who made the vaccine won't even take it, then I am going to question it.
1	Widespread vaccination for the coronavirus means that the virus will not infect as many people. This will limit spread through communities. Both Pfizer and Moderna report that their vaccines show approximately 95% efficacy at preventing both mild and severe symptoms of COVID-19
1	How come most people that are against the vaccine don't actually have any academic achievements?
0	My 13 & 9 year old just had covid & ran around like nothing happened. My little cousin is 3 & had a fever for 4 hours & ran around like nothing happened. These babies dont need these shots & anybody looking forward to this should be ashamed of themselves
0	Normalizing vaccine failure...classic! Up is down, what happened to the common sense of the people? Good lord we are in trouble
1	" Unvaccinated people are more likely to become infected, develop severe COVID-19, and die. In fact, unvaccinated people account for virtually all recent COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S. "
0	I am deeply offending by the fake science the WHO, CDC, MSM, Big Tech and the government have been throwing in everyones face! These genetic vaccines are very dangerous and were  never designed to stop Sars-Cov-2.
0	I live in Tennessee and haven't met a single person who has, has had, or knows anybody that has died from it. Seems to be a very illusive virus.
0	How Does It Affect Your Body? Badly.
1	I got the Jab today... I hope by this time next year covid is over...
1	We live in the age of MISINFORMATION, more people would rather believe some random post they saw a friend post on Facebook than listen to an actual scientist. Truly crazy times we live in
0	I'm never getting any sort of new vaccine until companies are held liable for when they kill or damage people. The fact they're protected should be enough to tell you something isn't right.
1	I had three full doses (the third one only five months after the second) and I’m so glad I did! The booster gives the extra protection needed.
0	Thank you but no vaccine
0	First it was get the two shots now it’s get 2 with a booster.  Next month or two it will be get the booster or you will no longer be considered fully vaccinated…  It’s no wonder why no one trusts you liars!
1	Excuse me, but what difference does it make because the medical profession are not early treating anyway... You feel sick, stay at home until you are well... Simple
1	At first, my mom was hesitant to get the vaccine. But when I had covid just last yr September, she immediately took it after the quarantine. I guess my mom was traumatized so that's why she got the covid vaccine lol
0	The vaccines don’t work . Try again
0	Not wanting to put something in my body that has been proven to not work, no thank you. You do what you want, afford me the same respect of choice.
1	no but your body will fight it faster and more efficiently if you get it. Also the Pfizer vaccine of FDA approved
0	Best way is to prevent the virus from infecting us by wearing face masks and physical distance as well as raising hygiene measures wpay out more important than vaccination
1	I think it should be mandatory!
1	I have to admit I'm selfish and mostly did it for myself but hopefully one day I'll be able to visit my out of province elderly parents and other at risk relatives.
1	Let these idiots that don't want the vaccine just not get any help when they are sick.
1	Josa from Marquette,WI , ill trip you next time i see you if you dont get vaxxed
0	So much hate from the vaccinated. Yikes
1	Highest rate of vaccinations in the world. Also highest transmission rate in the world. But just don't question the narrative.
0	In other words, vaccines are just needle exercises in the body.
1	there are a lot of people who got covid after vaccination but as the tweet says unvaccinated are 97 times more likely to die. if you understand basic math you will know why vaccination is important. embrace it rather than fight it. facts are clearly against those who are hesitant
1	Covid has totally wiped me out! Cannot imagine how I'd feel if I hadn't had 3 vaccines!
0	I can’t believe this is happening in America are liberties are being taken away little by little, Covid is forcing us to swallow our human rights to take the vaccine!
0	Go brother, stop vaccine
0	'You should never say YES to anything you can't say NO to" - some wise guy once.
0	I stand with the Unvaccinated!
0	But its perfectly safe!! Heart attacks, strokes, blood clots, death, severe illness!! Oh yeah thats for me!!!!!
1	I received my first Pfizer shot about 60 hours ago. NO fever; NO headache, NO lethargy. The injection site in my arm began to hurt about 6 hours after I had the shot. The pain was manageable without ibuprofen or aspirin. By the second day the pain began to fade and late in the afternoon it just disappeared. I worked out today and feel fine. From what I've read the second shot probably won't go as easily. However, at 70 years old I figure the reward far outweighs the risk.
1	I feel like this video is as vital as ever right now. Highlights the absolute importance of vaccines perfectly.
1	Sick of hearing about all this rubbish. Who really cares what goes on in Canada apart from locals. And notice how the Guardian allows comments on this subject but wont allow comments on anything debateable.
1	Getting covid & dying from it are 2 very different things. Yes u can still get CoVid & pass it even while vax’ed but it reduces mortality aka dying from CoVid. Ive seen many deaths & so far, in my personal experience, they were not vax’ed. So statistically speaking, the vax helps.
0	They are using human for experiment instead of rabit.
1	Republicans are gonna put themselves on the “endangered” list if they keep resisting the vaccine.
1	Nothing can prevent infection if you're exposed to any virus. Vaccines just lower the chances of serious illness/death, not infection
1	I get my first Moderna tomorrow!
1	Don't post anti vaxx disinformation
0	No. Why would a healthy person who never gets sick take a drug that is almost guaranteed to affect their health
1	THE COVID19 VACCINE IS IMPORTANT FOR ANY BODY.
1	What I don't understand is if your child cannot be vaccinated due to adverse affects, why would you then advocate for anti vaccination? Your child is now a part of the group that relies on herd immunity...advocating for anti-vax just puts your own child at even more of a risk...
0	TOWARDS THE PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT OF OPPONENTS? A disturbing drift in Slate, which pretends to "explain" the refusal of millions of French people to be injected with Pfizer by "childhood traumas" Are we heading towards the USSR, where political opponents were locked up in psychiatric hospitals?
1	No sympathy for those that don’t get the vaccine … bottom line it works …
0	No way would I take this.
1	Latest 3-shot vaccine effectiveness data vs omicron, summarized  ~50% against infections  ~90% against hospitalizations  ~95% against deaths
1	My father completed both doses of Covishied vaccine before 15 days...He is completely fine.(note : He has no any disease like diabetes,BP or heart problems)
1	No one is forcing anyone to get a vaccine. But you should lol
0	I’d rather suffer from covid than get GBS. People survive covid every day, but being paralyzed for life is terrible.
0	"... sole assessment of prior infections & #CovidVaccine responses based on antibody detection is not reliable & has serious limitations in individual patients"
1	The benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the known and potential risks. Get a COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 years and older as soon as you can.
1	I’d say get vaccinated.
1	Just make vaccines non optional and free, for fucks sake
0	I have a 99.5% chance of surviving without the vaccine
1	ANTIVAX is all about one thing and one thing only - MONEY!
1	98% of COV-19 deaths are unvaccinated. Get more people vaccinated and most of our problems will go away.
1	All the people dying from Covid wondering “what if” and regretting not getting vaccinated.
0	Don’t take the kill shot!
0	we’ve seen this before with a different vaccine right? So we have two vaccines that are set to start with phase 3 trials? This is huge that we have multiple vaccines doing well, but it still isn’t the final step. Correct me if i’m wrong.
0	The vaccine doesn't stop the spread or the chance of me getting it no need to mandate
1	The big thing about the vaccine is your body remembers how to fight covid, so if you happen to get it your body already knows how to deal with it meaning you get less symptoms and side effects.
0	I'm just astounded that people are still spouting (and believing) the vax propaganda.  The vaccine is NOT very effective and does NOT stop the spread of covid, and especially not Omicron.  FACT.
1	Thank you so much. I am shell-shocked because of so much unwarranted distrust of the people and systems in place to try to protect us. It's a "No good deed goes unpunished" situation, to a pathological degree. It is very hard to make sense of.
1	Before he died of Covid-19 in September, Nick Bledsoe was not shy about publicly sharing his opposition to masks and vaccines on Facebook. In April, Mr. Bledsoe, an auto mechanic from Opelika, Ala., added a frame declaring "I dont care if youve had your vaccine" to his profile photo and urged his father not to get the shot. During the summer, he posted a petition against school mask requirements, cursed President "Biden and his vaccine," and in his final post, shared a video casting doubt on the safety of vaccination against the coronavirus. Then, with his last words before being placed on a ventilator, Mr. Bledsoe agreed to get vaccinated once he recuperated, according to his father. But he never left the hospital, dying at the age of 41 and leaving behind a wife and four children. The day after Mr. Bledsoe died, his father started urging those who were unvaccinated to get the shots.
1	I'm 33 n have had no health issues whatsoever and I'll be 1st in line to get the vaccine when I'm able. For myself but more so for others.
0	How can anyone say a drug that doesn't have any long-term test results yet is totally safe? That's the main reason I'm skeptical about it.
0	My huge respect for everyone who speaks about vaccine sides effects
1	anti-vaxxers, anti bullying, anti evil, anti racism. U ppl can stop blame other and JUST TAKE THE DAMN VACCINE!
1	thank you so much for this information, Ted-Ed!! I just got vaccine yesterday and now I feel that my muscle is sore. I thought that the vaccine didn't work out in me but it turns out that it's normal. once again, thank you ted-ed
1	It does stop the spread of Covid if enough people are vaccinated. This is known to happen with all infectious diseases. There is a lot of information on herd immunity on internet.
0	So is the vaccine guaranteed not to have any long term side effects? If so how was it tested for long term side effects in a span of less than an year?
1	Oh wow, the uneducated seem to be gathering for a field trip today… Vaccine will not stop you getting it, it will lessen any ill effects. Say out loud now and it might stick
0	it’s proven… many r sick with it and have had 2, 3, and some countries may even be on 4th and still believing that these jabs work…
1	I love the part where daughter defies her parents to get vaccinated. She’s taking her health serious; non like her folks.  They’re prob out of shape and don’t take their health too serious.  Great job girl.
1	Thank you for fighting misinformation. Fully vaccinated with Pfizer and proud. 💪🏻
0	It's an experimental injectable clinical trial using us as guinea pigs..it is not a vaccine... the serum targets inner main organs..heart, lungs, brain...it's gene therapy.. i so wish people would research and stop believing the fear narrative. There's no contagion!!! Zero, none.. it's the flu ..influenza A and B...
0	There are many side effects that they do not tell you about
0	the vaccines cannot change our DNA because human cells have no mechanism to convert rna into dna but it can be done artificially in a lab and also our cells don’t contain th necessary enzymes to do this and neither does the vaccine. So, these vaccines are not changing anyone's genes, it is impossible for an mRNA vaccine to alter our DNA
1	antivaxxers have caused regionally eradicated diseases to have new epidemics
0	Pffft, who needs a vaccine
0	Irresponsible to say that the vaccines are “safe.” You don’t know the effect down the line of a 4th shot, nor of a 3rd, 2nd or 1st.
0	Just wait until the problems start as a result of the vaccine. Parents you don't know what you are doing!
1	The best way to protect yourself against Omicron, Delta, & all variants of coronavirus is to take the free, readily available vaccine. You've gotten vaccines before in your life, & it protected you from measles, mumps, rubella & all other bad things. Save lives. Get vaccinated.")
1	I got the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. I feel fortunate to get one
0	How is it that getting the vax means care for others when the vaccinated are still spreading the virus? There have been materially no changes in the rate of Covid cases or Covid death since the vaccine was released. If anything it’s gotten worse.
0	This Vaccine is made to turn people into sideboards And I believe I got on somebody’s nerves already for stating the truth
0	Yeah.... Like I've always said.... What vaccine???? I'm not unvaccinated.... Just unstupid...
1	Be safe, get vaccinated ASAP!
1	jesus sent you the vaccine to save you
0	What about long term side effects from the vaccine ....
1	This is the vax I want. One shot & you're done.
0	THE SHOTS DO NOT WORK!
1	I’m in my early 40s both vaccines kicked my butt the next day. I’m not sure why both affected me but the side effects lasted for about one day.
1	what are you even on about? You’re literally ruining your own life because you believe the vaccine is harmful. I think you need to ditch the conspiracy theories and scare stories on the internet which do no favours for you, and speak to a health professional who can then reassure you that this is not poison, it’s not a government controlled big reset. Don’t listen to the people who post scare stories, they don’t care what you do, the health professionals do care about you.
1	If you are not fully vaccinated, or if you are indoors with others, wear the mask. If you are eligible for a booster, get it. We are all in this together!
0	All my friends who took the shot got covid. I haven't and I have not gotten covid. Taking the vaccine gives you covid!
0	I haven’t had a covid vaccine and will most likely not get this one either
0	It will be a great Christmas for all of the big pharma shareholders
0	Honestly wouldn't be surprised if covid was literally only spread by the vaccine.
0	Because I prefer to avoid guinea pigging myself with experimental doses of gene code. Particularly when I know that the code is designed to make my cells start abnormally creating a spike protein that is strange to my body and causes my immune system to fight against it. I also realize there are very few people on the planet who have ever tried injecting gene code in such a way before, so outcomes are very unpredictable. Research into human reverse transcriptase, however, I believe, should make anyone extremely cautious. Idk, I just don't think it's a great idea to do anything like that experimentally with my body and I absolutely would never insist or mandate anyone else do it to theirs.
1	I’m a 12 year old that got the vaccine and I’m doing awesome right now. I would recommend the vaccine if you haven’t got it just so we could get back to normal
1	When she gets covid she change her mind there is a pandemic
1	GET BOOSTED
0	I used to have a brother, not since the polio vaccine.
0	I was fully vaccinated and still got the original Covid 19 version. I am 65 and a bit overweight. I cannot believe that people have been vaccinated 4 times. I can assure you I wont.
0	Most supposed covid deaths were actually caused by something else. Even when people die of the vaccine they will try to blame it on covid instead. Set of total liars.
0	Why is it so damn hard to respect people that do not want to or need to be vaccinated?? More than half of the people I know have gotten sick are vaccinated and oddly the people that have not being vaccinated recovered faster....something is wrong here.
0	Hey y'all I cried when I got the vaccine because I'm a big crybaby that's is still scared of needle's (they used the  baby needle too)
0	No way. We have had Covid recently without "vaccinations" and we all recovered within two days. Keep the poison for those who care.
1	I don't know who needs to hear this but Polio and smallpox never reached natural herd immunity. They were eradicated by vaccines.
1	Our Government did the right thing by announcing the covid-19 vaccine to the worl
0	told that a farm stores friend gotmthe vacxcine and was dwad in hours perfectly healthly then dead.
1	Showing this to my mother this weekend so she'll finally get me vaccinated
1	I got mine right away with no hesitation. For myself and to protect family also others.
0	I don't call it vaccine hesitatety I call it intelligent decision making.
0	Vaccine is poison and they know it and they are not getting their shots but want you to ,
1	Rights, obligations and responsibility goes hand in hand. Responsibility for oneself and one's choices foremost. As the saying goes, you make your bed, now sleep in it. Cant find any sympathy for those unvaccinated falling sick or worse. You brought it on yourself now go with God.
1	Anti-vaxers are just scared of needles
0	Interesting that this discussion was 3 months ago, before the virus mutated into Omicron. It has indeed become more infectious which increases the number of people who will be overwhelmed by it. This is where the vaccines are starting to fail
1	Why are anti-vaxxing retards even reading a science site
1	When people behave like children and refuse to voluntarily take their vaccinations, thereby putting the most vulnerable people in their society at unacceptable risk of grave illness and worse, they must then be treated as children.
1	must supply these VACCINATIONS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,no more deaths
0	A vaccine is a bioweapon given to idiots who believe everything they hear on the news to kill maim/destroy
0	Not FDA approved, there are cases where people and teens have died from the vaccine. I am not getting mine. Nothing odd about that.
1	I am generally in favour of vaccinations. I believe the approved COVID vaccines are safe and effective. Of course, the effectiveness here refers only to certain areas and is therefore limited in other areas. I am vaccinated and boostered myself.
1	Medicines and vaccines are not a commodity. It's not something to get rich with. It's something to save people's lives.
0	Pretty simple if people dont want to put something in there body then they shouldnt have to.
0	Murdered Babies in vaccines. Mrc-5. Wi-38. Human diploid cells. If you are against abortion you are a no vaxxer. If you are not a cannibal you are a no vaxxer. If you believe children should not be murdered you are a no vaxxer. If you approve of murdering children and eating them then you are pro vaxxer. But wait there's more. Do you approve of injesting other pollutants such as polysorbate. Aluminum. Mercury. Formaldehyde. Cow puss. Monket cancer cells? Recombinant Human Albumin. Research the ingredients.
1	Omg thank god I have been waiting to get my 2 year old vaccinated
1	I'll be happy to get the vaccine as soon as Bill Gates prove to me he got it. By the way who is this unintelligent buffoon you have on your show very disappointed.
1	Just here for the entertainment provided by the anti-vaxers
0	Yup, don’t have kids but if I’d did have there’s no way I’d have given consent for them to be jabbed.
0	Yep. I am unvaccinated as are my children. No one in my house has had Covid before. We are all very healthy. My wife is fully vaccinated (her choice even though I asked her not to do it). Guess who got Covid first and spread it to the whole family?
0	I am waiting 5 years and then MAYBE I will conside it.
1	Our country passed up 500 million more doses?  And the funerals go on.  The hospitalized suffer alone, no loved ones near.  The healthcare workers grow more weary but carry on.  The residents in nursing homes continue to be isolated.  Their families still weep.  Schools remain closed.  More and more people are jobless.  The food on the table has gone way.  34 days.....and then we say farewell...thank goodness.
1	hope the majority will take it. It's been so long.
0	Eye and skin irritation after exposure to evaporated #CovidVaccine:
1	I’m glad Jimmy and family are all OK. I tested positive for Covid, Have had cold symptoms for two weeks, but symptoms are not serious, I’m sure it’s because of being vaccinated and boosted. Those who think the vaccination and getting boosted don’t make a difference, it’s about minimizing symptoms and keeping out of the hospital please do it!
0	It’s so rare, it keeps happening. I’m good with my natural immunity thanks.
0	We whole family are not vaccined
0	people see through the lies
1	Just got my vaccine and feel fine!
0	We don't need NO VACCINATION!!! YOU GOTTA FIGHT FOR YOUR RIGHTS!!! #fuckcovid19 #fuckvaccine
0	Dr. Who? What? Where? I've already had the virus so I'm good thanks
0	Can anyone say "big pharma cash bonanza"??? Jab$Jab$Jab$Jab$ Get the picture?
0	On what basis do you say the Covid vaccines are "overwhelming safe and effective"?
1	COVID-19 vaccines help protect the community
0	My long COVID symptoms worsened after the vaccine and no doctor wants to acknowledge that. They’re in denial and treating me like a crazy lady when many other people are going through the same
0	Mm? But this covid jib is an experimental gene therapy never trialed on human beings before? I thought we were supposed to keep children safe from harm, not risk subjecting them too it?
1	Man I can't wait to get my booster shot. I'm trying to be first in line. Forget these people.
0	The vax is proven to be injurious, it increases the incidence of COVID, and it is unnecessary as COVID is less deadly than the flu.
1	Two doses about 6 months ago and I have covid.. easy peasy, maybe one crappy day so far
0	After all the real data has been coming out you have to have a death wish to take this vax.
0	If you're "supposedly" vaccinated than you shouldn't have to worry about those who are unvaccinated I thought.
1	It needs to be said, and I wish the news did. None of these vaccines have any affect on pregnancy or fertility. Sore holder and fatigue are the most common side effects. All of these laws are common sense and safe, your miss information or fear of something does not give you the right to endanger others.
1	OMG RIGHT IM GONNA GET VAXXED TOMORROW 😵💫
0	I can’t wait to get my 27th booster tomorrow. It’s been a week since my last, I haven’t felt like I’ve been in a safe space the past few days.
1	organizer Matt Tune, an unvaccinated 48-year-old from Chicago. He said he wants the event “to help change the current narrative … which is basically saying that we’re a bunch of weirdos and freaks who don’t care about humanity. And that’s not true at all.” No, weirdos and freaks sounds exactly right.
0	I am on triple vax, 3 doses for the last 15 days. I am Covid + this morning.  Can I say that the vaccine is ineffective in preventing transmission (the usual goal of a vaccine), without being called an antivax, toothless, conspiracy theorist?
1	thanks  i’m less worried about catching it bc ive been fully vaccinated and have gotten the booster and have a pretty strong immune system as it is so if i do get it i most likely won’t be very sick, but im more worried about possibly spreading it to others
1	I will take the vaccine, whichever one I am offered. So many people have died-if I can help prevent deaths of others, I am all in.
0	The covid vaccine is not healthy it’s mRNA splits and rewrites your dna
0	yeah im not taking it even if there is a mandate. and i will fight. i see whats happening in some places tho, and it just makes me more glad im in Texas.
1	A small hole in his argument here, he’s basing his reasoning for not getting the jab on the data not being up to date with the current variant, but even if he’s right, what happened in the time before when he was practicing without the vaccine and delta was prevalent, wasn’t it irresponsible not to get the jab then?
0	Yep, that's 8-10 doses they want to inject you with. When you see the damage at 3-4 doses. At the 8th, it's genocide guaranteed.
0	when he says that the vaccination only works if everybody gets it, he is literally admitting it doesn't work.
0	Well sit down little sheep an listen...... BECAUSE THE MASK DO NOT WORK AN NEITHER DOES THE VACCINE....
0	I work in health care and ever single patient I have had that has gotten the vaccine has severe side effects that knock them out for at least 1-2 days. I would not suggest the vaccine!
0	🍍Only vaccines that work are: Be protected respecting distancing🍌
1	got my first dose of Vaccine , this can be a help to my country
0	STAND STRONG....FIGHT FOR YOUR RIGHTS... FIGHT FOR YOUR FREEDOM. ...CANADA STANDS BEHIND YOUS...🇨🇦🇨🇦
0	The only thing parents need to know is don’t vaccinate your kid
1	Over 10 million first vaccine doses given out in UK. Amazing! Well done to all the hard-working NHS staff making this possible.
0	They're bribing people to get it
1	Just had my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine today. So far no ill effects
0	My friend has been vaccinated 3 times and is now in intensive care.
1	By the way scientists/doctors changing their minds are a good thing. We all make decisions based on information available at the time. But things change rapidly in this pandemic, and new evidence are presented all the time. So doctors updating their stance and views are absolutely a good thing (and essential) when dealing with this pandemic.
0	You can’t make this shit up…I had Covid a few weeks ago…I would rather go through Covid then have GBS from the vaccine
0	The problem with all these boosters is it just causes the virus to mutate. You can keep updating the vaccine, but the virus will only adapt to it.
1	There can be long term effects of COVID even for those who can only get mild cases. Get vaccinated as soon as possible. The risks of that happening  are a lot higher than the risk of the vaccine causing harm
0	I just feel sad about the whole thing. A friend told me the other day that one of the vaccines made him sicker than when he got covid (after getting the vaccine).
0	In other words, it doesn’t require vaccinating the entire population via mandates
1	Thank you.  some of us might already be frustrated because there are already people in our lives that are mean spirited antivaxxers that believe conspiracy theories.
1	Thanks Doctors, Nurses, scientists, researchers and all in the medical field that are telling the facts, even in the face of overwhelming ignorance. Thank you for all you do.
1	We the good people of Bauchi state Nigeria,are aware of your good effort n love towards us by providing for us free vaccines in our state.Thankyou so much for the kind gesture.
1	And yet it's not a real vaccine cause it does not prevent them from contracting or spreading covid? Wake up America,
1	the covid vaccine has a lower risk rate than a lot of vaccines
0	Vaccines aren't natural... Especially these new type of experimental vaccines
1	My heart goes out to every hospital worker fighting against this virus, and the ignorance of the general public against getting the vaccine. You people are ALL heroes- from the doctors and nurses, down to the office and maintenance staff. EVERYONE.
0	Well i for one won't risk MY safety, why would I also risk an unborn child. So I will not get the vaccine.
1	And shout out to all the anti-vaxx: ‘Believe what you want but please don’t force others into your way of life. There has already been enough pain this year. We don’t want another year of misery because people refuse to take vaccines.’
1	I know I should not be on the internet but I’m literally twelve and I have fully vaccinated since July, and I never had any side affects it may be different for others but it wasn’t bad at all.
1	we need those vaccines now
1	I literally just got my first shot of the vaccine today and my arm hurts like fuck but its Worth every SECOND of pain. Edit 1 month later...I got my booster had a week long reaction of feeling like shit still worth it
1	Unfortunately, there are tons of police with the same mindset. Covid was the biggest cop killer last year but they still fight vaccines
0	I’m not getting that shit I’m good lol
1	Hey everyone, let's all laugh at the antivax boomers in the comments who are disliking the video! Laugh at the clowns!
0	I will decline the covid-19 vaccine because no one knows the long term side effects and the short term side effects for someone my age would make me 100x more likely to have serious heart issues for the rest of my life.
1	The main issue with the pandemic is the anti-vaxxer
1	IT LOWERS THE RISK EVEN IF IT'S NOT 100% GUARRANTEED
0	My dad works in hospital they told him to pretend that he took it
0	With 0 long term studies... what could go wrong.
0	I kind of follow along what my daughter says. She’s a school nurse at a high school, just to the south of us. She doesn’t believe in it.
0	In my home country, 23 old people who got the Pfizer died from complications...
1	The vaccines save lives, go take it and help stop the pademic
1	Vaccines help to keep people healthy and ready for action.  Armies need soldiers who are fit for training and combat and not going to fall sick on duty.  That’s why armed forces are always expected to take all safe and effective vaccines. COVID-19 vaccine is no different to all the others they are required to take.
0	Breaktrough cases prove that even if I get the vaccine, I might still get covid. Why bother then?
1	I don t believe in mandating the vaccine but for Christ s sake just get vaccinated. It may not prevent you from getting ill but it will keep you out of the ICU and out of the fucking morgue.
0	If the vaccine has no significant effect on severe illness what exactly does it do ?
1	The funny thing is, if the vaccine had a death rate of 11 in 400,000, (2.75/100k) the antivax side would be frothing at the mouth over it.
1	But yeah… go off about how vaccines and masks are just as bad. I know math is hard for the ignorant so let me tell you that is 5"
1	Yes, it’s Satan and Milo who brought COVID to unvaccinated devout christians who rely on god for protection. You cannot make this stuff up
0	"your first dose" one down, five more to go
0	Unlimited booster shots?Sad until now I'm still waiting for Z variant
1	I just got the first vaccine. My arm is a little sore (the same amount of soreness I get from a flu shot). That's the only symptom. I feel perfectly fine otherwise!
1	Make them take it like the nurses
1	Just got my sputnikV today
1	It amazes me how much misinformation, lies, and sheer nastiness they can put into such a short "news" piece.
1	that's what this whole vaccine thing is ment to do...It's ment to weaken your immune system so that you will eventually be dependent on it to survive.
0	She couldn't find peer-reviewed research on the negative effects of vaccines?! I laughed out loud! Studies are done when there is the promise of money or power at the end of the research rainbow.
1	The vaccines might not help 100% with infection but they help a lot with symptoms
1	I’m usually a bit cynical, but these scientists with their decisive actions saved a lot of lives.
0	If they love transparency, release the FOIA act documents, and accept liability from harm.
0	If you are under 50 and took the shot you made a huge mistake
0	The more you comply the more restrictions and mandates they keep adding
0	I’m guessing she took it or was she always this dead ️
1	Vaccines protect the “herd.”
1	Im sure not all doctors are like him! Same with everybody! We all have different opinion. But to me i will stick with whats safe for my loved ones and to other people so i'll vacinate!
0	So who are all these shitballs still pushing the vaccine?
1	Get on lists, check very early every morning, travel if you need to a vaccination site. Now the vaccines distribution will begin to exponentially expand. Good luck, I'm 2 weeks after 2nd dose. Feels great.
0	rush hour vaccine. side effects is even Scarry
0	So, how is it justifiable to force Americans to get this “vaccine” for a disease with a 99.7% survival rate when the data show 80% of Americans had it & survived it with “natural immunity,” which the CDC showed is “superior” to “vaccinated immunity”? It doesn’t make sense!
1	There's never anything to worry about when it comes to this liquid. It is perfection. I always laugh when I see the headline "FDA begins trials to determine safety in people under 30" "under 20" "under 10" "under 5" "under 2" "newborns" "pregnant women" "women who WANT to get pregnant" "men's reproductive abilities" "people with heart issues" --- the answer is always SAFE SAFE SAFE SAFE APPROVED APPROVED APPROVED
1	“There aren’t enough studies on it.” Lady tell me about one study you read.
0	My body my choice, right liberals?
1	I have received both of my Covid-19 shorts and my entire family as well! If we don't all take this dead serious it will never end, so everyone please jump on board and get yours please!
0	The Polio vaccine works. So does the measles, smallpox, shingles, tetanus, mumps and rubella. The COVID vaccines don't work!
1	The injection has no proven downsides so not taking it is definitely a lack of mental acuity.
1	Wish mRNA vaccines were available in my country.
1	In a chat with a colleague this morning, they lamented the fact that "it's gotten to the point where it's easier to sell anti-vaxxers on NFT's than it is to get them to get vaccinated"
1	Due to me getting vaxxed and boosted my Covid was just me sleeping a lot. For unvaccinated people it can mean hospitalization. It is not the same.
1	How many times do we need to repeat that there are also vaccinated people in hospitals because they are much more in numbers???? Percentages are what counts, not numbers!
1	l went 4 my final dose today and l m fine even the first dosei which l took on 11 Nov 2022
0	I really don't understand.  The left stands by a woman's right to choose, doesn't this fall into the same category? Doesn't a person have autonomy over their own bodies
1	I NEED MY VACCINATION
0	Vaccine don't bring us closer it's a big LIE but LOVE is the key
0	absolute paralogism.... A man who got a very serious side effect, is one of the greatest promoters of Vaccines! We are living in a really strange period...
1	Got mine this morning!!!
1	I had my first shot of Modena 2 weeks ago and had a possible side effect of drowsiness 2 days after the shot. Otherwise, for an 88 year-old I seem to doing okay.
0	Unvaccinated and I had a "sorta headache" for a few days with Omicron. I know a handful of people who were vaxxed and had symptoms worse than I experienced. Disclosure: had COVID in our house in Nov. 2020 and then again recently in Dec, 2021. Me thinks that prior exposure and infection does something for one's immunity
0	Let's make this clear in case you're in dumbass crows…. Fuck you and your vaccine any questions????????
1	As a Londoner who’s been double-vaxxed & single-boosted, I’m furious & flabbergasted by this extraordinary #CovidVaccine intel. What’s the matter with people? 1/3 thrid of peopl not vaccinted in london.
0	I can’t wait to get my 27th booster tomorrow. It’s been a week since my last, I haven’t felt like I’ve been in a safe space the past few days.
0	To all those that vaccinated AND caught covid........ I'm unvaccinated and never had it......
1	Please do not let a fear of needles stop you getting your coronavirus vaccine or booster!
0	still not getting that poisonous vaccine. deal with it
0	He wants me to risk getting some similar issue because misery loves company. I am unvaccinted and untested and haven't been sick for years. Misery loves company.
0	Covid is another way the government is trying to control us. I had covid, extra sleep, a good diet and some pills took care of that. No vaccine needed
1	I had my jab today, I was a bit scared but I’m even more scared to think what COVID-19 could do to me.
0	I know a perfectly healthy man under 40 that had a heart attack within 15 days of being given his first jab. No thanks
0	If something was a cure and actually saved lives, it would NOT be free. Period
0	We choose not to treat Covid, instead we are told to rely on a vaccine that doesn’t offer immunity, doesn’t stop transmission and we have no clue about long term affects. My kid is has been unable to walk since she got it and I’m told it’s just a coincidence, my ass it is.
0	It takes years of trial and error to confidently pledge your life on a vaccine. How can doctors so easily administer these vaccines like a flu shot. As Doctors you should weigh the risks.
0	I'll vaccinate myself with fresh air, fresh fruit and big helping of jesus... or maybe I'm deluding myself?
0	In all this COVID-19 situation I rarely hear doctors and physicians stress the ultimate importance of trying to have a healthy immune system to combat the virus. Healthy immune systems can be established and maintained through proper nutrition consumption, herb consumption, water consumption, along with positive mental thinking, also along with fresh air deep breathing exercise and physical exercise therapies....
0	Natural immunity...is the "ONLY" way. Look up "Mass Formation Psychosis"...There is your answer.
1	"I can go to a gym "Girl you never been to a gym ,don't blame the vaccine. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
0	The AstraZeneca vaccine could give me a blood clot
0	My kids are not taking it
0	The one thing Covid has taught me is that for some reason everyone now seems to think they’re a fkin scientist.
0	Zero vaccines here, just like I don't get any others. Had Covid. Was mehh sick for a few days. Eat healthy. Exercise. Am not a lardass or have a co morbidity or immuno deficiency. Happy to live my life like usual. Cheers to the rest of you.
1	usually, in order for a pandemic becomes an endemic, it first goes from pandemic to epidemic, and then to endemic. Scince we are in an epedemic, take the vaccine to help the hospitals
1	Am Pfizer fully vaccinated.. Tnx biontech :)
1	I don’t understand.. people are dying yet we are worried about a few % of people that have some side effects?
0	Beware of the vaccine folks.
0	No number of vaccines and boosters stops you catching Covid and passing it on.
0	This is the end for me!!! No more vaccines!!! I’ve had enough now!!!!!!!!
1	Got mine last weekend. I’d never gotten it before I was pregnant but then I got the flu after the vaccine during pregnancy. And I decided I really liked not being severely ill. Since covid I’m actually more pro-vaccine than I ever was before.
1	I am a meteorologist from Israel. Ph.d. And i think you are doing unsmarts thing to decide not to receive the vaccine. As a nurse you give a very bad example to people . Any How, you look cute. Shalom. Greetings from Israel.
1	Boosted! Get vaccinated and get boosted!
1	Been surrounded by people with covid. Vaccinated..and boostered. Did not get it. It s magic. Thank you SO much.
1	I'm so sorry for your loss. I lost all sympathy for these selfish idiots who refuse to get vaccinated.
0	Our choices are being interfered indeed.. with LIES, CENSORSHIP and MANDATES.
1	Having an immune system is what makes vaccines work you bad div
1	my teacher just taught me pseudoscience vs imperical evidence. I now see how this works in the real world
1	To quote Rogan in that video, anti-vaxxers are “whacko”. “Paranoid and delusional” and “they want it all to be a conspiracy”. Pretty sad that those people he referred to in that way now look up to him and his misinformation is killing them.
1	I will get vaccinated to protect my family
0	Take your vaccine and ram it where the sun doesn't shine.
1	Why cant they just make the vaccine to spread like a virus. I mean we would all be vaccinated by now.
0	Big pharma is protected from liabilities on this experiment. And it's not fda approved. It usually take 5-10 years for a drug to pass. But this was waaaay to rushed by any standard.
1	Health care professionals still maintain that the people crowding up our hospital are the unvaccinated.
0	I’ll wait a few years to see what the outcome is with these vaccines. If I’m still alive, and the results are good, then I’ll happily get it
1	The vaccine helps prevent or reduce the spread of COVID-19
0	It’s not a matter of the covid vaccine being fine, or it being a conspiracy theory. It should be our choice. The government has taken your responsibility for your health. Now your health is the state’s responsibility
1	I’m finally negative. Never got super sick (no fever, chills or even cough) just sore throat, runny nose, and mild congestion) thanks vaccines. Not here for a debate anti vaxxers
1	I hope the mass production starts asap.
0	The vaccines are harmful and ineffective!!! Stop with this misinformation!!!
0	The mRNA technology is too new to be safe. Don't take the vaccine!
1	it is hugely encouraging to see so many vaccines proving and going into development
0	How much do you get under the table in cash?
1	I get mine on Friday!!! I LOVE SCIENE.
1	Anti vaxxers don't listen to evidence
0	Haven't taken the vaccine and now corona is not even seen as a deadly virus anymore
1	I got the vaccine
0	If only it was a vaccine and not experimental gene therapy. The vulnerable are the exact ones who shouldn’t be having it.
0	Thanks but no thanks.ill take my chances with no shot.
1	My second jab is coming up and I was sick and tired of not being able to find reassurance. It's like the entire Internet is full of conspiracy theorists, it drove me anxious and insane. Thanks for your inputs
0	I would be surprised if anyone who's vaccinated is alive 5 years from now!
1	Getting the #COVID19 vaccine #booster is an essential step towards curbing the spread of the virus.
1	They do not want to be vaccinated, but on the other hand they accept to be treated
1	If any anti vaxxers get Covid and are seriously ill, just leave them to it.
0	How do we know there won't be long term side effects that show up after months or years
0	Those who take mRNA vaccine are welcoming Cancer
1	It's not about a different point of view. It's about facts and lies.
0	Natural immunity works the same and is better!
1	Basing your facts from conspiracy theories instead of the science is just straight up ignorant
0	It's my choice and I just decided not to get it. vacc is suspicious.
1	Got the #BoosterDose something
0	It's called choice
0	lol, "its safe" no worries
1	My reactions to vaccines were a painful pinch and feeling slightly more tired. I'd rather be a little sleepy than die of a disease from the 1916's
1	people who are against vaccines baffle me- my sister wasn't vaccinated and she got whooping cough when she was a baby and almost died. It makes me so angry that people STILL wont vaccinate their kids.
0	“At least my COVID symptoms were slightly reduced” is being printed on a lot of gravestones these days
1	I'll take a shot every 6 months if it means I have a lower risk of contracting and spreading it.
1	Took the vaccine, still feel fine.
0	I will never take the governments vial of death.
1	It got me. Good job i'm fully jabbed = less severe illness, reduced chance of hospitalisation
0	My OBGYN is forever tryna encourage me to take the vax cuz “being pregnant makes ur covid risk higher” bruh I haven’t been sick since 2019!! I refused !
0	70+ allergic reactions which may cause further injury or death, and a <50% efficacy, I don't know what counties such as Indonesia and Singapore are thinking. I'm strongly disappointed at Singapore including Sinovac on their arsonol of vaccines to their citizens.
0	Haven`t had a jab and don`t intend to have one , the sheep can have it .
0	i will not take the vaccine as i dont know what is in the vaccine and there for i dont want to take a risk...
1	Yes it's safe
1	Lets make all the anti-vaxxers take it
1	good serve him right for refusing the vaccine im glad & thats the way I feel about any anti vaxxer
1	A vaccines efficacy rate is calculated in large clinical trials, when the vaccine is tested on tens of thousands of people,those people are broken into two groups: half gets the vaccine and half get a placebo.  Then , they are sent out to live their lives, while scientists monitor whether or not they get covid-19 over several months, and how those people fall into each of these groups determines a vaccines efficacy.
1	#Covid19 vaccines provide very good protection against infection and severe illness
0	I would love to have more info on the vaccine and pregnancy. Is there enough information to prove the vaccine is safe for woman trying to have a baby in their late 30's? This is what is stopping me from getting the vaccine. I don't know what is the safest option here. I have read that in the UK the miscarriage rate has gone up, it was also pointed out that most of the women were vaccinated.
0	I'm hear to tell y'all the vaccines are useless,y wife had three vaccines and still caught the virus
1	just got my second dose yesterday! God bless everyone, stay safe
0	I am 73 woman and before the series of Pfizer vaccinations, including the booster, I was very physically active. I walked 4-5 miles a day, lifted weights and pilates. After the first shot I started experiencing hip pain and was limited in walking to less than a mile. My hip pain has progressively gotten worse. It feels like I have a hot coal in my hip joint. Now this morning I barely moved my hand and my wrist experienced an aching pain. I can't lift anything with that hand now. The wrist was fine yesterday. I really wish I hadn't taken the vaccinations and just worked on my immunities level naturally. I'm pretty frustrated and truly wish I haven't taken the vaccine. Hopefully this is not something we will deal with the rest of our lives.
1	bro, just get yourself a vaccine, so life can be normal again
0	My immune system is the most precious wealth I possess. No vaccine for me, thanks.
1	I hate that we have come to a time when we shut up a Doctor and tell them they are wrong because we have "investigated"
0	Well still haven’t gotten one and never plan on it. Thanks for the report though
1	I am going to war with the anti vaccine propaganda groups who threaten our NHS.
1	think about this.... Think about protection
1	God damn it, the virus isn't a hoax
0	I'm not getting any "vaccine" poisons
1	As a pediatric ED physician , appreciate this post. Spread the importance of vaccines and allay the false notions ( autism , etc) . As you know , some of the vaccine preventable diseases are making a slight comeback .
0	Yep. Get a jab, with no long-term data, against something most healthy people have a 99 percent chance of fighting anyway.  Snake oil.
1	Do you have a brain? The first shots work but too many refuse causing this to never end and more variants!!
0	seem' to offer protection, 'appear' to 'offer' success at stopping omnicrom (a non-existent variant). How are the trials going so far?
0	You know vaccinated people are getting and spreading the virus right? lol lol lol wow
1	get vaccinated ASAP!!
1	Vaccines protect future generations.
0	Georgian hospital Nurse 27 years old woman died in 24H after get ASTRA ZENEKA stop it please stop
1	I’m vaccinated and boosted. Got Covid. Didn’t die.
0	What a surprise-and next week it will be "Why are people with 2 shots and 7 boosters being admitted to hospital?"Of course the answer will be because they haven't had their 8th.
1	I worked in Big Pharma for 30 years now, I will take the vaccines and I am completely sure about it
0	How come no discussion on natural immunity? No money in it for them thats why
0	I don’t want a vaccine no way, why can’t they treat the common cold, something isn’t right
0	Do you have any opinion about Graphene Hydroxide being found in covid vaccines at the microscopic level??
0	A severe allergic reaction, like anaphylaxis, may happen after any vaccine, including COVID-19 vaccines.
0	the vaccine can infect my child with the disease it's trying to prevent
1	It worked for smallpox and polio. It even worked for measles for a while until enough people became anti-vax. So yeah vaccine mandates work
0	It should alarm you that we are heading toward a society where you will need to offer up unlimited access to your veins in exchange for permission to live a normal life.
1	How can you trust that a meteor won’t come through your roof. It could, you know—it’s happened before. That and the vaccine killing you have about the same risk—-NOTHING IS SAFE. But the likelihood that Covid-19 will kill you is a lot higher.  Good thing you have people figuring things out for you
0	Thank you @OANN for airing the panel of expert doctors and nurses telling us how dangerous the #CovidVaccine is. Everyone needs to watch this! And please keep the covid vaccine away from our children.
0	Yes! this will protect my families Gene's for the rest of their lives! (By manipulating and allowing them to be infertile) hooooray for modern RNA manipulation with technology
0	How can we be sure of the vaccines without proper testing?
1	Anyone who is an active anti-vaxxer and who actively works to sabotage the vaccination campaign and keeps the country in a health crisis, if they catch Covid, as a punishment, they should be isolated and be left to die.
1	My Husband and I, Both 68, took both vaccines and had no problem at all... I even helped on Valentine's Day at my daughter's flower shop. I had to get the second vaccine then.... I went right back to work and I never was sore or tired....
1	I’ve been so nervous to take my vaccine I finally took it yesterday! Feel like poop but it’s passing . The first day is the worst for me  hope tomorrow is better
1	I spent the summers between my last 2 years in high school working at a camp for handicapped kids and adults who were going to spend the rest of their lives on crutches or in wheel chairs because the Salk vaccine was available too late for them. When was the last time you met someone who experienced Polio? I got the flu for the first and last time when I was 16, and made sure I got vaccinated every year after the vaccine became available. I got pneumonia when I was in 3rd grade and spent the rest of the school year working from home and I got PneumoVax as soon as it was available and whenever a new version is released. I renew my tetanus vaccine every 10 years. I showed up as soon as Moderna was released and got both shots and the booster. I'm 77 now and I have never missed a day of work due to an infectious disease. I hope the anti-vax crowd is as fortunate.
1	I will not hesitate to get my vaccination. It is time to get contro9l of this pandemic and move on.
1	I'm glad people actually understand vaccines are not dangerous.
1	I got both doses last year. For the first shot, my arm was just sore for a day. The second dose was a little bit unpleasant. Had a slight fever and runny nose for a day, but after that I was alright again. Till now I haven’t gotten sick, so that’s good! Stay safe everyone!
1	The younger generation need to stop be so bloody selfish and do the right thing and get the jab,they want their life back
1	I’m in no way anti vaccine but my biggest fear is that it keeps mutating to get around the vaccine which will kill those that aren’t vaccinated. My family are big anti-vaxxers and it scares the hell out of me.
0	There was never anything to vaccinate against
0	Clotshot... call them what they are: Dangerous, unnecessary clotshots that have caused more side effects in 10 months than all other true dead/weakened/live virus true vaccines did in 50+ years.
1	Take your responsibility and take those vaccine shots
1	mRNA vaccine has been developed 3 decades ago and has been used clinically for 6 years.
1	I enjoyed Pfizer vaccine
1	Do you want this pandemic to end or not? Then get the vaccine
0	mRNA sounds like cancer to me.
0	dont take this crap, liar fauci
1	Here’s the deal: Unvaccinated individuals are 97 times more likely to die compared to those who are boosted. Protect yourself and those around you by getting vaccinated and boosted today.
1	I also hesitated to get vaccinated in early 2021 while pregnant, it’s hard to take such a big risk when you invest so much time and love in your baby:) glad to hear that these pregnancies may be safe despite becoming vaccinated prepartum
1	Hi, i have stiff person syndrome and have taken Rituxan IV. I had the Maderna both shots all I had was a a little rash at the injection site and weakness I have been a medic for 30 years and I am very educated. I say for those who are afraid of getting the shot my opinion is get the shot.
0	I regret taking this vaccine
1	See all the unvaccinated folks are giving the virus a home to mutant into a different variant. Maybe one that the vaccine can not handle. That makes this a social issue not a personal issue.
1	I really happy that vaccine will be made from COVID-19 i hope it come out soon because i really wanna for people’s life’s be saved from covid
0	How he chatted the guy! Thanks to the doctor who injected him with a Placebo album. In your Pfizer puck. What are you going to do Micron?
1	The top scientists had a lot to prove before actually being taken seriously such as: efficacy and effectiveness of mRNA vaccine and expedient approval process for such vaccine that otherwise could take several several years.
0	I’m still not getting vaccinated.
0	Nonono. only a small portion of doctors say its okay. lots of doctors dont agree.. its too early to say what side effects can be.. and YES side effects can be much worse than getting covid
1	Everyone wants the pandemic to end. Most are doing what the experts are telling us to do in order to make that happen. The old advice still applies. Get vaccinated, wear a mask, social distance, wash your hands.
1	I trust vaccine, I don't trust anti-vaxxer
1	I had covid last April... My body took care of it... Naturally vaccinated
1	We vaccinated about 130 individuals over the weekend at Grant! Thank you to all the dedicated volunteers and participants! #togethertowardhealth #letsgetvacccinated
0	The only ones that are blind to vaccine dangers are the woke and financially invested.
1	Unfortunately it seems that many people in the same position as this man are being ignored by their doctors and being told they are imagining things.
0	I won't vaccine myself
1	I am doubled masked, double vaxxed, boosted, and socially distant. We need to trust the science which means listening to experts like Dr Fauci. We need to enforce the vaccine mandate for everyone (including children), create a booster mandate, and enforce an N95 mask mandate. It's not that hard and anyone who does not comply should be sent to jail or an isolation camp.
0	It's very hard to hear him say how incredibly safe this vaccine is when I know so many people who have suffered terrible side effects and in hindsight wish they had never had the vaccine 🙈
1	Feeling boostered GlädjedödareInjektionsspruta and had to come back to this beautiful building Idolfixerad
0	The businesses that jumped the gun and fired their unvaccinated employees should be sued into oblivion!
1	"Organizers had estimated that 20,000 people would attend the rally, marching from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial, according to a permit issued by the National Park Service. A smaller crowd of several thousand had arrived on the Mall by early Sunday afternoon." I guess the other 17000 were dead or hospitalized.
0	I will never trust these vaccines, GOODBYE to vaccine.
1	Wow! I’m fully a pro-vaxer yet still found I had believed one of the myths! It never sat well with me that I “knew” for a “fact” that vaccinated people can “still spread the virus” I’m so grateful for finally seeing perspective on this issue
1	I am so happy to announce that my grandparents just survived corona, thankfully they had already gotten their vaccinations, so they were some what prepared. God bless everyone's loved ones.
1	Why are people using the rising case numbers to say that the vaccines are useless??? Vaccine reduces the symptoms and prevents the health care system from collapsing due to covid hospitalization
0	RIP to the 45 people in America who died from the vaccine 🕊🙏🏾🕊🙏🏾🕊😥
1	Please get vaccinated- if not for yourself, for the young kids/babies who can’t defend themselves as easily from Covid
1	I had the pfizer vaccination today. Feel so lucky to be given one, wasn't expecting to have it this early
1	People who refuse the vaccine are wrong, but shaming them is gonna make them way less likely to eventually get it.
0	Vaccines are great for growing immunity but natural infection is also great for generating immunity probably the better, the longevity remains to be same if the longevity is good the virus can be eradicated in the same time.
1	Guys don't forget to get vaccinated, it's safe and effective..also wear your mask on daily basis, stay safe.
0	2 things I don't trust 1)government 2)doctors They both hide very important information
1	i cant be first in line in not in thoses groups when its my time ill take it
0	Yet no one is talking about what’s inside the vaccination itself. If big pharma are so confident, why hide behind legal immunity under emergency use?!
1	Most of the problems we are facing today depend on the fact that there are unvaccinated people
1	Because it is the best, proven medical tool to prevent serious illness/death from Covid19. Of course physical distancing, masking, also help too. You’re welcome.
1	Before recommending COVID-19 vaccination for children, scientists conducted clinical trials with thousands of children and no serious safety concerns were identified.
1	in the end, I'm glad you refuse to be vaccinated because we need less of your kind.
1	After my first vaccine I never had any any side effect :D
0	Covid will end when EVERYONE STOPS COM-ply-ING.
0	It will give you cancer
0	note to others: DO NOT take the "booster" or any other "vaccine".
0	I agree that the data for the long term effects isn’t sufficient. I got vaccinated since I’m much older but I still wonder what the long term effects will be and how it will affect me in the future.
0	Theyre keeping sheep.
1	Feels so good to be able to say I was vaccinated two weeks ago! Two more weeks until my second shot. Though I do woâ€¦
1	Finally. This vaccination has a promising role in immune compromised folks. Fewer side effects. We have 5 vaccines and 6 treatments. The virus has variants. Battle is joined in the last chapter of this pandemic. Getting 75% to 100 % of human adults vaccinated should make this manageable in 2022. The vaccination of children helps them and slows spread outside the school well. Over 4 billion people are vaccinated now at some level. There are 7.88 billion people on Earth ??.
1	A vaccine stimulates the production of antibodies that can then be used to fight off Covid-19, if the virus is encountered
0	Who gave him the "credentials" and the authority to speak about vaccines and what's "good" for the entire world?
0	Gee, normally it required 8 to 12 years for a vaccine to be tested and approved, Now it takes 8- 12 days. who are we kidding?? It is a blatant crime it is killing people.
1	Thankfully we had vaccines by now. Human Civilization would have crumbled with these many cases without the vaccines. This is pretty much equivalent to 100k deaths in a day.
0	My colleague died because of the AZ Jab
1	I had no side effects with Pfize
1	I feel so bad for the hospital staff. To me this is annoying and frustrating but they have to face the consequences of this ignorance and stupidity every day, I don't. I can not begin to imagine how they must be feeling
1	It baffles me so many dumb people are against vaccine in the middle of a freaking pandemic
0	Beautiful woman reporters! I’ve taken a Covid-19 vaccine and flu shot and I felt horrible! So I’m thinking twice before getting the rest of them! Especially when dealing with existing health concern and I don’t want to make me worse!
1	I was vaccine hesitant for awhile since I had covid 2 times and only got moderate symptoms but now with the rise of the delta and other variants I decided to get vaccinated and so far I am very happy with my choice and my ability to look past all this fake news crap about the vaccine!! Now I just gotta convince my dad! Wish me luck
0	it's not the anti-vaxx/anti-madate individuals who are radical, it's the people trying to force people to take a poorly tested vaccine who are radical.
1	I didn't even second guess rolling my eyes and considering some of those theories out there crazy, thinking the people who belived that stuff must be kinda uneducated
0	NO TO COVID VACCINES I'M NOT YOUR EXPERIMENT!!
1	I have two little girls getting the shots as soon as they are available. And seeing as how we live in Oklahoma there shouldn't be any lines waiting to get them. We can probably just walk right up to the pharmacy and get them within minutes.
0	If you're under 50, COVID is less dangerous to you than the flu, and for the younger, less dangerous than driving. It's almost certainly less risky than a rushed vaccine with likely side-effects which should be preserved for the most vulnerable anyway.
1	Mothers from poorer countries would go to ends of earth for vaccines for their children, especially when most vaccines are not available for them. It's tough to see anti vaxxers campaigning for no vaccines that's supposed to save their lives
1	Just got the janssen yesterday. Woke up feeling sore but its normal anyways
0	We eat the virus ....we are not afraid of it.....strong immune system is the key to fight viruses......not just a vaccine anymore....it's idiotic to hold on to vaccine
1	One of the biggest hurdles in reaching the world’s most vulnerable people will be convincing them that vaccines, and the people providing them, can be trusted.
1	Rogan has claimed that myocarditis is a bigger risk from the vaccine than from Covid. He’s said young people shouldn’t get vaccinated. He’s said many things that are false or bad health advice
1	Vaccine is safe 01 : 100000. This is negligible. And those who died after vaccination did not die directly due to vaccination but underlying diseases or conditions. If money is the lone idea of vaccinating people why should USA give free of cost to several countries. Why should India promise to vaccinate its citizens free of cost? Surely, the people with chronic non infectious diseases can be seriously affected by Corona. Those who are having communicable diseases will also suffer badly. Many elderly people have already died. The argument that I won't be affected as I am young and strong is a selfish one. They should remember that they may survive unscathed but they can be the reason for infecting and killing another vulnerable citizen when they test positive for Corona virus. It is in the interest of elderly people and fellow citizens of your own country all must be vaccinated.
1	All vaccines are def not fake, as you sarcastically put it. They have literally saved lives from many diseases.
1	Well...here in South Africa,some church leaders have secretly told their followers to reject vaccination.With some followers distributing the anti-vaccination instructions through text messages;WhatsApp or word of mouth.Since,these churches are based in poor communities,the rest of the community finds out about it.Then they begin to question vaccination,with some people deciding to avoid vaccination.
0	Blaming non-vaccinated people for the results of the pandemic is a distraction from the failure to improve the medical system and generally having enough equipment, nurses and doctors
0	Yay to all of you wonderful people against mandates on this thread!!! You make this unvaccinated person feel less alone in this civil war.
0	Avoid this shot...
1	I'm not throwing away my shot!! Got vaccinated and perfectly alright today
0	So vaccines aren't effective against Delta, yet government makes vaccination mandatory
1	All vaccine science is designed to imitate and trigger natural immunity. The suggestion that natural immunity is inferior to a synthetic/genetic vaccine undermines all trust and faith in public health, and, in science itself.
0	My exact thoughts late last night, nobody is any freer than March 2020, vaxxed or Prochoice, & they never will be if this debacle continues
1	im laying in bed after getting my 2nd dose yesterday 😁 om running a fever a mad headache..BUT I'd do it all over again
1	people will be at much greater risk by not getting vaccinated
0	Vaccines kill!!
0	What is the vaccines doing for the people
1	Remember friends: We very much support the vaccine and encourage people to get it. What we are against is vaccine mandates.
0	I’d rather suffer from covid than get GBS. People survive covid every day, but being paralyzed for life is terrible.
0	Official Public Health Data showing a 40% increase in Excess Deaths of the Under 65's suggests the #Covid_19 #CovidVaccine is to blame as Heart Disorders among 15-44-year-olds have soared up to 118% higher than the Five-Year-Average #ClotShot #JustSayNo
1	I’m a paediatric consultant. I’m triple-jabbed because the science clearly shows the benefits of #CovidVaccine far outweigh the risks for me,& being vaccinated reduces the risk of me passing the virus on to others, including my elderly mum & vulnerable children #GetVaccinated
1	Uneducated person to doctor: ‘You dont know what you’re talking about”
1	Darwinism will take care of the anti-vaxers
1	It's really stupid to not ask the nurse about the details of the adverse reactions she's seen. It's such a mistake to not go into this in detail, since it seems to be stopping a lot of people from getting the vaccine.
0	In a county that is 88% vaxxed, infection rates are at the highest at anytime during the pandemic. The Vax doesn’t work. End the mask mandates
1	It is safe on the short term, as determined by the data. Long term Ill effects of the vaccine are unknown as the vaccine has not yet been given to a large population. Don’t forget that you take risks every day. A short trip in a car is probably far more dangerous than the vaccine that has been studied as thoroughly as possible given the short period of time allotted.
1	Vaccinations are required to qualify for a transplant, there is a safe, free solution to his problem
0	I got covid and so did my family. Non vaccinated, all alive and healthy. Vaccine doesn't make a difference. It's an individual thing.
1	So it's okay to not get a vaccine bit not to get an abortion in Texas?
0	Yeah honestly I cannot even date someone who can be this easily brainwashed ... lord knows I also would not want to be pressured into getting an experimental vaccine everyday.
0	Pfizer only want to make money
1	Omg 😲 what if  people were like this when we were offered vaccine against against measles,  rubella, polio etc??? We didn't know if they would work or what was in them!!!!! This is just sad 😔
0	I'm not taking it. It's not what they say it is. Even they say it's required for exchanging goods, and even threatened to arrest even executions, not taking it!
1	I completely disagree with the opinion that telling emotional stories is more persuasive than presenting data.
0	One Vax to rule them all eh? You cant make this stuff up folks. Let the beguiled fall for this nonsense. They will only have themselves to blame when it all goes pete tong. Me? I will stick with the natural immunity system. Its free, tested over billions of years and requires no action from me but good healthy living :)
1	You should get the vaccine. Don’t believe the conspiracy theorists
0	I understand when people get the vaccine and then say "oh it was fine I didn't have any side effects" but what scares me is that there could be side effects that don't appear until much later and we haven't had enough time to test that... I don't want to be a guinea pig
0	It is irresponsible to promote a vax that's given with no proper informed consent, is not a real vax, causes spread of Covid, ruins the immune system (VAIDS), and caused 23,000 deaths and 1.9 million injuries. Do your due diligence. You're being lied to about needing this vax.
1	Please, everyone who can, who is healthy and able, please get vaccinated! You are saving the lives of those you don't even know!
0	No liability  No chance of it going into me
0	higher risk by not vaccinating? How so? Can you show me anything that supports that claim?
0	Should be effective.... "Should" is the key word. They are still giving false hope. Then when it fails, they will continue to blame the unvaxxed.
1	If such a small virus can reach underprivileged peoples why not vaccine? It is everyone’s responsibility to make sure that it reaches far beyond virus has reached .
1	Hello, and thanks for this video! I'm a health care worker and have had all my vaccinations thus far, but have become a vaccine sceptic, due to being bombarded by the anti vaxx narrative. But, also, I must admit, it didn't help my scepticism the way that the government has imposed vaccinations on us so aggressively, I believe it should be a choice, not forced onto us. Anyways, I'm going to finally book my first vaccine shot this week, after seeing your video. I've had enough of the conspiracy theories and all the surrounding bs.
1	Being skeptic about the long term effects of the vaccine is fine, but then you should also consider the unknown long term effects of the virus and the increased probability of future infection. Why would the medicine be more dangerous than the infectious disease?
0	I love how they are talking as if 2 doses is ineffective without the booster. Glad I don't have to worry about whether I should get a 3rd dose or not since I don't have any doses!
1	Vaccines are definitely necessary. Though, It is unfortunate that we are creating an industry where pharma can keep recommending top-ups/boosters. Seems financially convenient
0	Covid vaccine are for ignorant people only
1	To any anti-vaxxers reading this, I don’t freaking care if you don’t vaccinate, ok? Just, vaccinate your kids. The fact that you think you know more than a profesional doctor or scientist with a carrer just because you saw it on Facebook is freaking disgusting. But most disgusting is risking your child’s life just because of that egoist thought. The murderer isn’t Bill Gates, doctors, scientists or the government, YOU are the murderer.
0	If you get Covid, you no longer need the vaxxes or the boosters. Word is already out, coward.
1	I can’t imagine the world without vaccines.
0	The jabs are the cause of hospitalization and deaths !
0	More propaganda, we knew a new one would come out as the old one goes away.
1	bet these guyys arent vaxxed smh
1	Unvaccinated and uneducated.
0	The "vaccines" and the subsequent booster jabs, lower the natural immune system with each jab. This makes the person more susceptible to infection. Eventually they will die either from the infection, Antibody Dependent Enhancement, Myocarditis, Blood clots, brain hemoraging, cancer or some other related cause. Sounds like fun doesnt it jabbers?
0	No, I don’t believe it’s safe, too much rushing to get the product out. No long-term trials. I do not trust it. I do not trust the process.
0	gov't forced medications is just not a good idea. There are more treatments for covid...not just a vaccine. If you want a vaccine..go ahead. If not should you be forced?? Careful now. Vaxxed or not should be equally concerned about this
0	FUCKKKK i took the vaccine and it turned me into one of them transgendered creatures. The 5G mind control signals are also forcing me to piss and shit myself!
0	How can they find a vaccine for this, but not for cancer or aids etc. And also so quickly?!?! Makes me question everything
0	They should do a documentary on severely injured patients from the vaccine and the percentage then
0	Some of us have not been brainwashed
1	A lot of people can not get the vaccine because they live in poors countries, stop be ingrates and take the vaccine that the governament PAYS for you
0	I know for sure I'm never getting it! God Bless
1	Ok help me out here, with all of them antivaxx ranchers going to Coutts to protest vaccination, why do they vaccinate their cattle?
0	fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported
0	I'm not getting it nu uh YOU CAN'T FORCE ME
1	I am thrilled to be vaccinated! May need to take a shot annually, as we do flu shots. That is fine. So thankful for medicine.
0	Best thing for kids is that they catch it and get the immunity. Not stick them with some experimental garbage. Couldn’t make it through half the video shit hurts my brain too much.
0	Don't Take This Evil Dangerous COVID-19(SARS-CoV-2) Vaccine.
0	Fauci said a few days ago that he’s optimistic we’ll have a vaccine by the very end of this year and I legit teared up.
0	No one creates a disease without creating a cure at the same time
0	If we could all get vaccinated by the holidays it'd make it the merriest and happiest it's been in a LONG time.
0	Everyone has rights not to take part in an experimental vaccine programme !! Dr Mengele crimes against humanity NO
0	Why does common sense need to be peer reviewed? The data doesn’t support young people needing a vaccine to survive Covid. The vaccine doesn’t even stop Covid.
0	Might? Could? Could also cause harm... who knows???
1	And I’m still for the life of me am trying to figure out why , if you’re protected (vaccinated), why would you have a problem with me risking my own self health??
0	Another booster Coz the first 3 jags did t work! So here’s another one
1	Anti-Vaxers dying from covid, I call that sweet irony...
0	Why would ANY amount of shots of a vaccine that doesn't prevent infection... prevent infection?
0	Im absolutely sure that Gingers cannot catch Corona virus Microbe, so my vaccine is available to any (inferior) non ginger people
1	That's good. If you're gonna be a moron and not wear a mask, not get vaccinated, and then OD on horse paste... stay home and leave the ICU beds to non covid patients.
0	Our vaccine is only God
0	The vaccine is not safe
1	I want to spare a hospital bed for someone who really needs it
1	All children can benefit from vaccine protection
0	The doctors that push this need to be held liable. They know, or should know, there isn't enough research.
0	I just Love a good propaganda campaign
1	i just got my second vaccine dose. no symptoms at all
1	Bc a week after 1st dose I got covid deadly variant and I am waiting for 3 months to complete as doctor suggested for 2nd dose .
1	I'm lucky enough to have Pfizer Vaccination !
1	Those who don't believe in science, and think only God can make them sick or cure, are better off dead.
0	Never taking the vaccine! I believe in healthy living and not this corona vaccine
0	A very sad day in Waterford, Ireland 23 yr old #RoyButler funeral Smiling face with tear Healthy young man gone because of an #experimentalVaccine The politicians and medical establishment have serious crimes to answer for. #CrimesAgainstHumanity
1	Covid-19 has been around for about a year, so the duration of damage ("long covid") is not yet well known; the number of deaths is known. The U.S. and U.K. have been vaccinating for several weeks now, and so far the known side effects and after-effects compared to the virus make the decision easy.
0	Risk of miocarditis in 18-29 yr olds was around 1 in 50,000. Average football stadium holds around 30,000 people. There has been 1 cardiac arrest in the stands at week the last 3 weeks in UK. Is a cardiac arrest within 28days of covid vaccine being reported on yellow card? Ive had 2 in my family in the past 4 weeks after the booster both dead. And my heart was really pumping after the 2nd dose.
1	Vaccines are an incredible thing and I'm grateful that we have them
1	Fuck the stupid ass cunts that do not get vaxxed that's why.
1	Near zero risk vs. being vulnerable to Omicron. Easy choice for me: get the third jab.
1	I was worried in the beginning but i got it anyways (Both doses of Moderna Covid19 Vaccine) and i’m completely fine. I felt sleepy the day I got the second dose though but that’s about it. Mom got Johnson and Johnson and she’s in the age group where clotting occurs most even if it’s rare but she was fine after her shot and it’s been a couple of months. Do it being able to relax a little bit after getting the shot alone makes it worth it
1	Their justifications for veing anti vaxx were purely personal. Its like if I was biten by a dog and then told everybody not to get dogs and spread misinformation about them just because a dog bit me
1	Has Dr James had the Hepatitis B vaccine which is a requirement of all clinical staff likely to come into contact with blood and body fluids?
1	It is sad how the anti-vaccine movement has grown in this pandemic, not due to facts and logic, but absurd conspiracies. We are doomed. Smithers, shoot me.
0	If the guy who created the MRNA technology is saying do not get jabbed, I ain't going to!
0	Why is natural immunity being igorned when countless studies show it is as good a protection if not better than vaccines?
1	Those weekly test should be at the expense of the unvaccinated, not taxpayer dollars.
1	Very well said!!! I was reading some comments on this that went back a year and not a thing has changed for those who refuse the vaccine. I really don't care if they get it or not, but me, my whole family and friends have been vaccinated, given the booster and have gotten on with our lives.
0	No, there is no brainwashing going on. Everything is fine! Just take the vaccine. Just take the vaccine. Take the vaccine. Take the vaccine. The vaccine. The vaccine. Vaccine. Vaccine.
0	We should respect the choices of people. We all can make the choice for our health & our bodies. But also for others around us.
1	I trusted the “ old school “ science and technology. We all got the j and j and no Covid here.
1	Who cares what these anti-vaxxers think. Leave them alone. Sooner or later covid will take care of them...
0	Best thing I did was avoid any vaccine and I bought a ton of Pfizer stocks in 2019 during the crash of the market. Needless to say my Pfizer’s stocks are doing great and they are paying me dividends
0	You can’t trust anything in the world anymore.
0	My other half got vaccinated. Been sick ever since. Don?t know if it?s related. I refuse to allow anyone tell me what to do. My body. My choice. Something like that anyway
0	If the development of these vaccines is one of the best accomplishments of science in recent memory, scientists have been slacking.
1	Ugh. I'm just as tired of this pandemic as everyone else. But it's never going to end if there are still anti vaxxers. THEY are the reason this keeps happening.
0	If your vaccine works why do you care if I'm not vaccinated? If your masks work why do you care if my face is free? If your mask AND your vaccine work and your STILL scared… stay home!
1	I can't belive how selfish unvaccinated people are!
1	My sister works in a hospital which is completely overwhelmed by all the patients with COVID.  \\nThere are ZERO patients there because of bad reactions to the vaccine.
1	My friends younger sister had a temporarily weakened immune system due to treatment for her skin, and she caught chicken pox from an unvaccinated kid who had gone to school without knowing he had it. This is a less extreme case but it shows how easily people’s choices effect everyone else.
1	The chance that you get infected if you are vaccinated is very less compared to the not taking the vaccine. So it's a common good.
1	If Natural immunity is so good then why is my nice going thru her third bout. She's unvaxed. Funny cause she keeps getting sick while those vaxed around her don't.
0	Why I never been vaccine it and I live a normal life in Canada ???? I never get sick? I go everywhere even work with the public. Tell me why?
0	The vaccine is pure poison!
0	Crimes against humanity
0	would you acept a drug or vaccine where the drug company has no liabiliy as to any harm caused by the vaccine. would you accept a vaccine which is still undergoing trials. im not an anti vaxer, the answer for me is no, and im shore there are millions of others who feel the same, unfortunatley they are trying to take our voice away.
0	Vaccinated people can still get Covid and spread it. So no use of vaccine.
0	It’s so rare, it keeps happening. I’m good with my natural immunity thanks.
1	Vaccines are safe.
0	I don't trust the government and i'm never gonna take the shot Lol
0	Alot of the more serious side effects seem to be getting left out here ?????? Myocarditis, blood clots, death etc. At least be upfront about the risks..then you might gain more trust from people.
0	Pretty soon, almost all people dying from covid will be deniers or antivaxxers.
1	This is litterally what my family and I have been praying for! WE NEED THIS VACCINE ASAP
1	So they don’t believe you can catch Covid but they do believe you can catch a vaccine make it make sense
0	And then they will tell us that this vaccination campaign is not a scandal! Is it true that Pfizer has a disclaimer in case of side effects after vaccination? - Libération
1	This is what happens when the misinformed, the uninformed & the deluded get together in groups & share their fantasies.
0	I haven't been ill for many years and I'm simply extremely afraid that I'll ruin my immune system, which always works perfectly, or that my body will become dependent on the active ingredients in the injection.
0	You almost had me until you started emotionally blackmailing the woman. In my experience, going outside and seeing new shanti towns of homeless people made me realise that the government was lying to us. I can't unsee it. For all the ro-vaccine people there, you need to clean up the lies being told before we can trust you. The biggest lie is "we're all in this together."
0	And HUGELY increase risk of death or serious injection injury
1	I just got the first vaccine. My arm is a little sore (the same amount of soreness I get from a flu shot). That's the only symptom. I feel perfectly fine otherwise!
1	The main goal of vaccination is not to prevent you from getting infected, it’s to avoid you from hospitalization. And still as of today, people can’t comprehend that simple explanation.
1	Unvaccinated people are killers
1	Vaxxed and proud if it. Following the science and take my responsibilities to others seriously.
1	Respect, this is gonna save so many lives... Thank you science !! Good job to all involved ...
0	What does vaccine do that immune system doesn't do?
0	By definition it is not even a "vaccine". Approved vaccines sterilize the virus or at the very least build proper antibodies. This is an "emergency use authorization" gene therapy which does nothing except worsen your immune system. Worst human experiment known to mankind!!
1	I wouldn't go near him for treatment as I wouldn't trust him when not being vacinated
1	so that's unfortunate but the first hospitalization was before the vaccines took effect... if anythng you just proved your natural immunity didnt help you
1	It's hard to win an argument against an intelligent person. But it's impossible to win against a dumb person.
1	Everything has a pro and a con, risk free vaccination is the same nonsense as risk free living.
1	Man, I wished my parents were as sensible as these ones. Mine are so far gone, my dad actually cried on a car ride home because I said I wanted to get the vaccine. Probably the first thing I'm doing when I turn 18 is getting the vaccine.
0	I agree with these nurses. No vac for me
1	The vaccine is effective against hospitalization and death. 900k dead in America as of today, the vast majority unvaccinated. Billions worldwide vaxxed and fine.
1	BOOYAH!!!  I received my second @moderna_tx COVID vaccine today.
1	This was straight forward and helped ease my fears. Thank you Dr Strong
0	I'm not putting these vaccines in my body. You don't know what dangerous chemicals are in it.
1	Happy he touched on the value of getting low income countries vaccinated. We can boost all we want but as long as new variants pop up in countries with low vaccine access, we will keep seeing the same story
1	My childs father said he will sue me for vaccinating my son. So he got fully vaxxed last weekend. Texas.
0	Blood clots, nervous system attacks, stroke, bells palsy just to name a few. My vax sibling got the clots and palsy...it's been 6 months and she's still suffering. My elderly father also got bells palsy from the vx...going on 8 months for him
0	well then i guess theyll never get normalcy, because i dont need the shot and will never get the shot
0	So the vaccinated pose a risk to the unvaccinated. Tell that to our world leaders who are making out that it’s the other way around!
1	I have already been vaccinated so I encourage people to do the same like I myself
0	I have been safe since covid and I'll remain safe without any vaccine in Jesus name.
0	When I look at the figures from other countries, which go into more detail, the vaccination no longer protects against infection
1	I wish the best for the people you interviewed and I hope they all recover and stay healthy, that said by choosing not to get the vaccine to some degree I feel like they put themselves in that position.
1	A known medical exemption including but not limited to allergies to any of the ingredients of the vaccine and a religious exemption providing that the individual is a member in good standing with an established faith tradition that eschews various medical interventions. Your individual beliefs independent of such a religious body would not count, as there would be too much room to abuse that.  Otherwise, no. get the shot, and quit looking for excuses. The virus should scare you infinitely more than the vaccine.
0	Be not inoculated with the seed of deceit.
0	No the major side effects of the unvaccinated is loss of jobs!
1	Now that this is approved, I'm going to get it. If it's been given full approval I have no reason to believe it is any more or less dangerous than any other vaccine I've gotten.
0	Getting a new vaccine every year... oh pls no, my arm will eventually fall off lmfao
0	The vax is LITERALLY heartbreaking!
0	good, now i can sit back and watch the Sid effects, and then take the fully devolved vaccine in a few years. thank you guinea pigs for taking an experimental drug for me.
0	I am not getting vaccinated because I do not trust our new communist government. I feel there are very bad things going on behind the scenes. If you agree, follow me.
0	Can you please explain why in countries that have the highest and earliest vaccination rates, such as Israel or Gibraltar, have some of the highest hospitalized double vax populations?
1	Such a damn shame that we can't give the vaccines to people that want and need it in different countries. This is infuriating.
1	if the vaccine, which mimics the virus’s effect does harm, than Covid would have done the same or much worse.
1	One of the extra ordinary things that I have observed is the speed at which the science is moving  the speed at which we are learning new things about the virus and developing the vaccines as we know vaccine development is normally quite a lengthy complex and laborious process. We have to believe the modern day Science & Technology and vaccination program.
0	Hurry get your booster, then get Covid a month later, repeat.
1	Anti-vaxxers are posting that vaccines don't block spread or catching Covid. That is utterly false.
0	This is really disturbing to me for the fact that there is no long term study.  I would think that it would be treated like any new experimental drug and be warned against in women pregnant or nursing
1	No excuse NOW! STOP MAKING IT POLITICAL GO GET THE SHOT! so we can all get back to living.
0	It seems like so far even those who got covid after vaccine had mild cases so hopefully it will still help.
1	Yes I was skeptical at first but because i have a comorbidity I got it rather than get covid and have 10x worse
0	Its an experimental vaccine, the long and medium term risks are unknown, according to Fauci, once you take the vaccine, you immediately need to mask up, social distance, and avoid crowds, to protect you from a virus with a 99+% recovery rate, doesn’t really seem like a compelling reason to take the jab. I will gladly contribute my place in line to someone who may actually need the vaccine (some one in a high risk category with several comorbidities for example).
1	Our yoga instructor died from Covid before vaccines were available.  Breathwork is a major part of our practice and is considered to have all sorts of health benefits.  He'd held a small gathering at his home, and I'd opted out, as it didn't seem wise.   Nearly everyone came down with the virus, a couple had to be hospitalized.  He meant well--RIP.  While I subscribe to natural health practices, I strike a  balance when it comes to pandemics.  Got vaxxed as soon as I was eligible.
0	For the first time in history, the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who refuse to take it... Hey Global why don't you report on that?
1	Best birthday gift
0	DO YOU REMEMBER... November 18, 1978 Jim Jones said that everyone needs to drink this and it will save your life! ALL 909 people died! Joe Biden says everyone needs to take this shot!!! DO I NEED TO SAY MORE
1	Coronavirus vaccines reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 and significantly reduce the risk of developing serious illness and being hospitalized.
0	Nope not me i live in Florida and will never get vaccinated and its my body my choice
0	No-one should be allowed to force another person to have a medical procedure. No-one.
1	Will I take the COVID Vaccine? Yes. Do I trust it will work? Yes. Do I think that once I have the vaccine, I am immune to COVID-19? No. I would still take reasonable precautions till this whole thing blows over, but I will feel a lot better about things. Vaccines do not create immunity…they enhance your resistance to the disease
0	Covid *vaccines has never been about covid immunity. Its has always been about you not dying when you get it. You americans sure are slow af
0	I stand right with him. I am no doctor so I can’t medically explain why I personally won’t get the vaccine… but I am right with him. Definitely pro-choice.
1	Get vaccinated, wear a mask around susceptible people or anyone who requests it, and take care of your own self.
0	My wife and I are both completely non vaxed and we both currently have Omicron. Yeah our symptoms have been bad and we were extremely sick for a few days but are now slowly recovering. Who knows how bad we would be right now if we were vaccinated..
1	It's definitely not caused by our safe vaccines. The scientists know this much.
0	The covidists spend their lives making reductio ad hitlerum against the anti-Pass (remember Darmanin and his Nazi clapping), but immediately get on their high horse when an anti-Pass throws their 4 truths in their face!
0	Ha. This is a joke. Nothing can be determined "safe" with no long-term studies carried out.
1	Looking at this thank god I live in Ireland. 70% fully vaccinated. We were slow to get going but getting there now. Please take the jab.
0	Can't stop hawking poison jabs and lame books, can you? You are all washed up. Just disappear already.
1	if the vaccines are so safe and effective,why can't you sue the companies that make the vaccines? if adverse reactions are so rare,they should not be worried about an extremely rare lawsuit here and there right?
0	Deep down, you know this is unnecessary and cruel.
1	I mean it is even free so why would you not take it?
0	If vaccines are so safe then why can’t we sue the pharmaceutical company when our child becomes vaccine damaged following the shot? For me....It’s a moral issue. I would not be injected with fetal DNA tissue.
1	It'll be such a relief hearing people are getting the vaccine
1	Vaccines aren't perfect, but getting vaccinated lowers your chance markedly of ending up in the hospital or ICU.
1	As an autistic person with allergies who actually went into anaphylactic shock as a reaction to a COVID vaccine, I don't understand why people could possibly be anti-vax. I went to get my shot and had a reaction. The doctors gave me an epi-pen on site before I was rusehd off to the hospital where I was held under observation and given some additional meds, and was clear to go home in a couple of hours. I felt completely back to normal in two days.    Yes, this is a serious reaction and it can be really scary, but you know what I think is scarier? All the lasting side-effects that the diseases can give you, or dying of them. I have a friend who used to run marathons and had COVID early on in the pandemic. She's still recovering and gets short of breath walking up the stairs. That's a much worse outcome to me than what I went through.      All in all, I'm currently in a special medical program here for people who had a severe reaction but want to get fully vaccinated safely, and I refuse to let people try and use my experience with vaccines as an argument that GETTING SICK and DYING or suffering LONG LASTING COMPLICATIONS is somehow BETTER than running the small risk of feeling bad for a couple of days.    And thats not even adressing the hate people have against autism! Vaccines don't cause autism, it's been debunked again and again. And even if they did, are you telling me you hate me so much you'd rather let your kids potentially suffer or die of a completely preventable disease? Because if that's your stance I don't even know where to start.    And those allergies I meantioned? I'd much rather deal with those than with the measles or polio or COVID. Anyone who'd like to debate this with me I'd LOVE to hear your stance and arguments.
0	Sick until proven healthy is no less tyrannical then guilty until proven innocent.
1	There's so many of us here in the Philippines who want to be vaccinated but the vaccine supply is very limited. Please produce more vaccines & provide them to poor countries like ours.
1	Simple. They work. But they fade badly.
1	i currently live with my family because i can't afford to move. they're all anti-vaxx :/ i wish i had the option to not hang around them.
0	I’ll take my chances without it
0	Why do the health officials look so unhealthy?
1	I got vaccinated on this day afternoon moderrna vaccine it's good to my body
0	I don't doubt the vaccine. I refuse it.
0	Not safe enough for me to put it into my body
1	Unfortunately doctors and nurses are not over covid because the unvaccinated insist on running to the hospital when they get short on breath and then tie up resources there.
0	No one should be taking these “cocktails” that are statistically the deadliest and most injurious than all other medication over the past 30 years combined. Far safer and more effective treatments are available if necessary, the vast majority recover fine with nothing at all.
0	Anyone who willingly goes out there and allows such poison in their body is absolutely crazy!
0	My mother got 1st shot of Pfizer hours later ----- same day had a stroke, I will never trust this vaccine
1	Persistent symptoms (“long Covid”) is a continuing research area. Honestly, the pace with which we’re learning about the risks and consequences has been frustratingly slow. At least for some of the symptoms, though, it's likely that the more severe the initial episode, the more likely the development and long-lasting symptoms. So, vaccination should help. EJR
0	It's people's right to refuse something they are not sure about.
1	Imagine refusing the vaccine and end up in hospital with breathing problems due to catching covid.
0	This covid thing is so overrated by now ,it's ridiculous if you ask me at this point. So over it.i dont even look at the covid news. Sick and tired how the media hypes this up
1	I'm definitely taking it
1	Thank you soooooo much for sharing. I am so tired of people spreading these lies just to create fear. That is so cruel. I shared your post to one friend 3 times she needs to stop starting fires. With her untruth.
1	Vaccine is very important because if we give our children they have good health
0	Lots of unvaxxed people also have very mild cases of the virus too. No way to prove that the jabbed have less serious cases.
0	It is not tested enough
1	Vaccines do not have effects that come up 10 years later however viruses do. I personally got vaccinated as soon as I was able with no regrets. Each one of us who gets vaccinated brings us closer to ending this.
0	Honestly I ve never met anyone who thinks they re injecting us with microchips in real life. But I do know several doctors and nurses that are wary of this vaccine since it s so rushed and untested. There is literally no way to know if there are long-term side effects right now.
1	He should get a new job as he clearly does not care about people when not wantig to get vaccinated. So work somewhere else..
1	Hundreds of Millions have taken the vaccine without any of the idiocy the wackos said would happen if they took it. Aristophanes was right... Stupid is forever.
1	i will take it as soon as Im able to
0	I’ve had covid and a natural immunity. I’m a senior and the survival rate is 98.6% Those are good odds. I have boosted my immune system from day one and would suggest everyone else do the same. At best, covid and other Sars vaccines are minimally effective and some of the ingredients are propietory, so you don’t know what you are putting into your body. It is still a clinical trial and everyone that gets it is basically a guinea pig. The Sars will keep adapting which we’ve known all along so you’ll be told you’ll need endless boosters. No thanks.
1	With the vaccines, the cases of COVID-19 are going down. Thank You for the warp speed of the vaccines being available and a big Thank You to the Nurses, National Guard, and Volunteers for their service of saving lives.
0	People forget that you can be pro vaccine and anti THIS vaccine.
1	Vaccine works better, no surprise.
0	Got covid this month.  Stayed away from doctors and hospital.  It was a really bad cold.  Took the drugs that cam not be named along with vitamins and good food.  One week later I am all well.
1	We should all get vaccinated
1	They re worried that an experimental treatment that skipped animal trials, was produced under Emergency exemptions to normal FDA safety tests, who s producers are all immune from lawsuits related to adverse affects as a result of taking the vaccine is being shoved down our throats by all the institutions who ve proven themselves through their deceitful conduct since the advent of COVID to not be trustworthy.
1	I remember being amazed when the COVID-19 vaccine was made so quickly, and after watching this, I am even more amazed by how revolutionary this new way of making vaccines is. An applause to everybody who contributed in making and giving out these wonderful stuff. And thank you for the good video.
1	Only listen to the experts that we want u to listen to...Just don't listen to all the other experts that have come forward...
0	if anything my body should have been defenceless but the whole thing is a fucking hoax and tbh I wouldn't be surprised if vaccines make you more susceptible to it
0	Why risk serious side effects for something that has a 99% recovery for non vaccinated ?
0	People who have been infected, felt little to no illness and don't want multiple injections
0	Fully vaccinated means you will need a new jab every 6 months. Carry on with this craziness.
0	I am an athlete. I got my second dose of the covid vaccine 3 days ago. The next day after the vaccine, I couldn't sleep. I had the worst fever ever. Today is my 3rd day after the second shot, I feel normal but my stamina when I workout is not the same. I feel like I get fatigued much faster than before and I run out of breath much faster than I used to. I swear I am not lying.
1	John is talking about a peer reviewed paper which shows massive benefits to getting vaccinated. He clearly states there are massive benefits to getting vaccinated multiple times.
0	I’m actually don’t want to vaccinate my toddler if covid-19 vaccine come out in November. I’m a Pro-Vaccine person, but I think this vaccine is getting rush, I may be one of the first people to get it in November because I’m a CNA at a senior health care facility, my husband have asthma and he’s a front line worker, so he may be able to get it too, but I think is too risky to inject a young child with a vaccine with so little testing. Is a hard decision to take.
1	So they're effectively admitting that "those who refused the vaccine... died." For Fox that's progress.
0	I had hemorrhage stroke 4 days after my second maderna shot. I'm only 32 years. DOCTOR ARE TEARTING LIKE SHIT TELLING IM CRAZY FOR SAYING IT WAS THE SHOT
1	I am so happy to have taken the step and got the shot.
1	My uncle died from covid, please send prayers our way. Please get vaccinated Edit: He was not vaccinated, my grandpa also died from it and was not vaccinated. On the other hand my gramdma was the only one vaccinated in their house and she suffered a bit of the sniffles and got better in days. Get vaccinated!! 39
1	I realize that vaccines are mostly safe for most people ,
0	The vaccinated are spreading delta
0	It's all about money. The vaccine companies making money and politicians supporting them making their money.
0	I'm not against vaccine buuuut usualy we have to wait 12 years to be sure of a vaccin... annnnd it's quite short
1	Like Cockroach Bait, they will carry the virus home, and kill off the remaining nest of Domestic Terrorists.
1	I trust science over conspiracy theorists. Thanks for this video.
1	I work in clinical trials, and I know the standard operating procedures when study drugs are put on the market.  The data, and all raw data from research comes from regular people and NOT the pharmaceutical company. This comes from doctors, nurses, and research coordinators working in university hospitals.  Generally speaking, physicians do not collect and report data. This is usually someone who does not have a medical background or may. In cases as such, data is sometimes reported inaccurately.  Additionally, there will always be adverse events.  Whether it is related to COVID-19 vaccine or not, adverse events will always be reported and can range from farting, knee pain, to severe dyspnea. Then, a safety board monitoring panel then gets together to determine if a serious adverse event is associated with the vaccine or not.  If you are hospitalized while on study, then there is a possibility that it can be associated with the vaccine.  Serious adverse events = Related to study drug/vaccine  Adverse event = unlikely related to study drug  Point is, there is no such thing as a safe drug and not even the vaccine. The truth is, YOU should determine what is good for your body and what is not. I am pro-vaccine, but I am also smart enough to question whether or not something is good for me. And no, you are not a moron if you decline the vaccine. I think there is a huge witch hunt to convince someone to take something that usually takes 5 years to get approved
1	For those people who are against the #CovidVaccine, I would hope this graph help illustrates the stark difference in mortality. Is dying, or worse still being crippled for life, worth it to not #GetVaccinatedNow? 20x greater mortality, & greater severity of disease & disability
0	I thought the vaccine was going to protect us. I believe they lied.
1	Thanks for everyone who commit themselves to make the covid-19 vaccine!
1	Fantastic, My arm is ready !
1	It is not as effective but it is an option for people who didn’t want the strong moderne or Pfizer vacc .
1	Hopefully most of this new south africa will be vax soon
0	Never will I ever take that bs.
0	Imagine blindly taking orders from liars, theives, pedophile mass murderers, yet thinking your more virtuous than those who disobey
1	I got 1 dose of the vaccine and caught COVID after. Was only sick for ONE day. Why would you choose to be sick?
0	7 billion people x 65 bucks a jab x 2 jabs x 2 boosters x however many more booters they tell you to take, is why this is never going to end.
0	The vaccine will damage my body, no way that I will take the jab
1	If frontline NHS staff don't need jabs neither does ANYONE else. LEAVE OUR KIDS ALONE
0	Whats the point even taken them since majority only got mild symptoms from covid, me included.
1	This is really sad to see even educated people against vaccines…
1	I just got my first shot (pfizer).
0	There are other ways often based in ancient tradition to keep the body and mind healthy. The long term reliance on the next generation of vaccines to combat the next generation of viral infection is not the answer.
0	You vaccinated still spread it and get it.  When will you start making sense??
0	Science is happening right in front of our eyes. The 2 most vaccinated countries in the world Israel and Australia are experiencing the largest amounts of new covid cases. Stop calling it a vaccine. It's gene therapy, that's causing more harm than good.
1	The point of the vaccine is to prevent severe illness and death. Your body builds the antibodies so that when you are exposed to the virus
0	One must realize, the pogrom against the "unvaccinated" being committed across the planet, is a tactic by gov. to redirect all the hatred and hostility which otherwise would be justly focused on they themselves for their immense crimes, on those who refuse "the jab". Its obvious.
1	Now if we can only get people (like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Sarah Palin, and so on) to stop spreading anti-vax nonsense we might have a fighting chance. People are so stupid today.
0	AS THE VACCINS DIDN'T WORK.....WHY NOT TRYING NATURAL IMMUN...LESS EXPENSIVE,AND MORE HEALTHY
0	1. "The vaccine is safe and effective." 2. "The vaccinated need to be protected from the unvaccinated." How can both these statements be true at the same time msm?
0	She doesn’t want to do the test on natural immunity. She wants EVERYONE to get the shot. Why? A true doctor would not push the shot so hard. It’s all about the money!!!!
0	To all my unvaxxed brethren out there: HOLD THE LINE!!!
0	Society, vaccination is need stop This is genocide…..
0	We must be free to decide to take it or not. Period.
1	I got AZ + Moderna for my first two doses and I was secretly hoping to get Pfizer as my booster to complete the set and unlock some kind of achievement/trophy. But practicality won out - I took what was being offered to get a shot sooner rather than later.
1	Good man. He has more guts and compassion for humanity than all the anti vax nutcases combined! Parents raising him right. That young man is going places!
1	Time to listen to health care professionals instead of politicians and YouTube quacks.
1	There is nothing to worry about. Get the shots. You may feel slickly sick fro a day but almost everyone I know had no symptoms or really mild symptoms like chills or feeling tired. The only two with more sick-like symptoms both had covid previously and felt sick for a day.
1	I went and got vaccinated as soon as I could, for my own piece of mind and safety ... I really don't understand the reasons the unvaccinated hospitalized are giving now.
0	Look at third world countries that are doing much better with omicron despite their very low vaccination rate; natural immunity is more effective than vaccination.
0	imagine a vaccine so safe you have to be threatened to take it
0	Nicely explained. This has helped me to decide against getting vaccinated for now. Thank you.
0	thats a lie if u get covid you dont need to put the disease in your body why are you that weak quit being so weak
0	The  government has no business whatsoever telling the citizens  what to do with our bodies.
1	Much better to be vaxed than not.
1	No antivaxxer should have the right to work in healthcare. Period.
0	Awesome! More money makers for big Pharma and the sheep that trust them.
0	I was so happy when I saw the dislike number on this video. If you want a shot, go get it. People don't want it.
1	Solidarity, public spirit and Christian charity oblige us to protect life. The lives of others, too, not just our own.
1	Both my parents have Pfizer vaccines, one has a medical condition and the other has been double vaccinated with Pfizer and synopharm (I think that’s how you spell it), they said there’s barely any side effects but if you do some research, the age group you mentioned have random chances of suffering slight pain and heavier arms but that’s it.
1	I am triple vaccinated and tested positive for COVID as well.  Had a mild case BECAUSE I am vaccinated.  This is also not unusual for other illnesses that we got vaccinated for as kids.  A small percentage will get ill despite being vaccinated.
0	“If you have to be persuaded, reminded pressured, lied to, incentivized, coerced, bullied, socially shamed, guilt-tripped, threatened, punished and criminalized ... If all of this is considered necessary to gain your compliance -- you can be absolutely certain that what is being promoted is not in your best interest.” - Ian Watson
1	I’m a 16 year old from Fairbanks Alaska and last week me and my 53 year old dad got our vaccines together ofc because anyone 16 or older in AK has access to the vaccine. Neither of have had any side effects whatsoever, there were no symptoms whatsoever either. I assume every Hasan fan knows that getting a vaccine is the right decision but seeing as I got my vaccine much earlier than most people my age I have the authority to tell you that it is very safe. I implore you to get it.
0	BIOWEAPON
0	Healthy but unjabbed have to be fined while the jabbed can go around catching and freely passing convid around. Yes, that definitely makes perfect sense.
1	Equitable #vaccination is a moral imperative, and we must come together in our shared humanity to ensure that everyone gets a #vaccine
1	Get the booster shot. It is saving lives and keeping vaccinated folks out of the hospitals
0	This tracks. I’ve been baffled by the suggestion of many to get vaccinated or get a booster two weeks after recovering from covid. This just flies against all logic and knowledge of basic immunology to me. I thought 90 days but 6 months sounds about right too
1	The vaccine guards against more moderate cases but there is something about more severe cases that evades the vaccine. Thus a vaccinated person who would otherwise get a severe case still gets a severe case (i.e. your chance of severe disease is unchanged regardless of whether you are vaccinated).
1	Just got my second vaccine dose today and I am now in bed with body chills and my head is on fire. Felt the symptoms about 10-12 hours later. I cannot wait for this bloody Covid to be over!
0	Oh Jesus.. he also sent the devil.. the vaccine has not helped anyone from getting covid.. god also revealed the evil going on but so many sheep are completely fucking oblivious
0	I talk backswords and have a horn growing out of my head!!  But never mind that. Vaxx is safe and effective
0	The vaccination doesn't help at all, half my circle of acquaintances has corona and that despite 3 vaccinations.
1	I also have an immune system, mine is better prepared to tackle COVID-19 because I’ve been #vaccinated Because I know that #VaccinesWork
1	The way I see it, if you choose not to get vaccinated & get sick, you don’t deserve the treatment of hospital staff.
1	If you have not been vaccinated yet, register now & get vaccinated at the earliest
0	I'm being forced by my company to take the vaccine
1	Omicron isn't Ebola; Delta was as bad as the Yellow Fever! The vaccine made the Delta milder.
1	Yeah and don’t worry about anything. It’s completely safe. Research has been solid and proven safe Take their word for it.
0	I know more people in hospital from the vaccine than covid.
1	We now realize we were played.
1	Then stay away from population and leave your job. It’s that simple. We vaccinated people don’t want you around us.
1	THESE PEOPLE ARE SO SELFISH AND IGNORANT I AM APPALLED
1	I am glad to be protected. I got my second booster shot on Thursday and felt awfull from then until Friday.
1	What gets me is the “in my opinion, I think it was developed too fast.” Bitch, what the fuck do you think progress is? “It took years to develop x,y,z vaccine…” Yes, and people people used walk up to a tv to change the channel! Remember TV Guide?! I had to fucking TIME when to watch shows! Now I watch any show I want on the toilet at work! It’s called PROGRESS!
0	Just tell us how many hundreds of boosters we'll need to get for the rest of our lives already
0	Over 93% of Australians are doubled vaxxed and life expectancy has *increased* since the beginning of the pandemic. Tell me again how the vaccines are “unsafe”?
1	This vaccine technology is possibly one of the biggest achievements of modern medicine. I think it's beautiful. I wish more people could see the wonder of it.
1	Vaccines will help keep you healthy
1	We are so grateful that have had our vaccine, we thought everything was very well organised. A big thank you to all, we know how busy you are but you always seem to answer with a smile
0	County Watford, Ireland 99.7% vaccinated. Yet has the highest numbers of COVID in the country. How does that work?
0	Murky science from the Left with jabs every 2 mos. Vaccines are supposed to generate memory b cells that can produce antibodies when needed again. But now with boosters are are artificially keeping antibodies up and not allowing memory b cells to do their jobs.
0	Canada: Alberta Premier to announce end of Vaccine Pass! Resistance pays off!  Soon only Véran, "Pfizer and McKinsey employee of the year", will be left to defend the shameful Pass! Stop!
1	I got Pfeizer in March. Every physician I know took it and that’s good enough for me.
0	I personally will not risk and wait for the situation to develop, and in any compulsion, I will firmly say that I am afraid and in such a situation I do not have - unless by force of the right to force me to vaccinate
1	I get it to stay alive as I like living and to protect my loved ones and society in general.
0	Vaccines is the answer if the patient will end his life.
0	To all my unvaxxed brethren out there: HOLD THE LINE!
0	So why did my mother got some symptoms after taking the vaccine? The vaccine is fake
1	I really don't understand why people are so scared of the vaccine. Half the time, those who are protesting against the vaccine are drinking energy drinks full of aspartame
0	another day still happily unvaccinated ^_^
0	With any unknown, parents are very frightened of doing something to their child that might have long-term ramifications
0	THEY AIN'T SAFE AND HAVEN'T FINISHED TESTS
0	I have massive respect for this Doctor and I will say if she was my Doctor id have no problem seeing her as my Doctor. I respect her choice not to have an EXPERIMENTAL VACCINE in her body
1	Protect yourself and get vaccinated
1	Had it and did not like the 10 days of sickness. However because I have been vaccinated I didn’t end up in the ICU.
1	I think that is awesome, especially if these self-medicated morons would stay away from hospitals. Of course that is just a pipe dream because when they can’t breathe anymore, they’ll be running (not literally) to the emergency room.
0	Sometimes you just can feel where something is not right and that most definitely includes this Vaccine
0	There is no vaccine for COVID-19 as of right now no matter much they claim there is.
1	got fully vaccinated. Then after a month i got covid hehe... Still thankful for being vaccinated. I have a lot of medical problems that is respiratory related in my previous years such an bronchitis and pneumonia. If i haven't gotten any vaccine. I may have severe symptoms. Luckily i was just classified as asymptomatic when i got covid.
1	I will just mention that I am totally pro-vaccine and will be getting a booster if and when I get the go-ahead to do so.
1	I'm really glad that you had the opportunity to get your shots!!
0	Why push vaccine if there’s ivermectin?
1	No vaccine is perfect. No COVID vaccine will be perfect. But vaccines are our best option.  You need to consider if you trust your government and health care service that approve and supply vaccines.  If you have concerns about allergic reactions then try to get vaccinated in a hospital where they can easily treat allergic reactions.  There is no guarantee with vaccines.  Everyone responds differently to vaccines.  I trust that my government has made a good decision in approving a COVID 19 vaccine. But I do not know how reliable your government is.
0	Vaccines are NOT working. Focus on treatment. Big pharma made billions on snake oil vaccines.
0	Since getting the vaccine my bloodwork is not normal.  maybe a coincidence but I'm not sure. I do wonder if I didn't take these shots if my bloodwork would be normal
1	How do they know exactly what the efficacy is if they no longer have a placebo group to compare to?
0	I had COVID and haven't gotten a "vaccine". Why would I want to get a vaccine that doesn't work and hasn't had years of research when having COVID in my experience wasn't that bad (in fact lots of other common illnesses I've had were far worse than 'Rona)
0	To prove the vaccine doesnt cause any harm takes years, not weeks or months. How about that?
0	considering the risks and threats of this biological agent, only a truly insane man would go for the injection
0	Covid was a lie . It was never more dangerous than the flu , less so in fact .
1	My grandma should not die because of you
0	Well, what they don’t do is stop infection, symptoms, or transmission. “You had one job!”
0	Wow, most media outlets won't mention vaccine side effects.
1	Those vaccinated are less likely to be infected therefore less likely to spread the virus.
0	All covid vaccines are evil
0	I don't believe this for one minute..They are pushing the vaccine, now the booster, now the new covid..its all political bs..
0	This isn't "any other vaccine". This is a communist forced vaccine that Democrats wanted injected into you so bad that  they stole the election in order to succeed in it happening.
0	Still not getting it.
1	Why not just get the shot - it's free! Then you don't have to pay for an illegal card.
1	"My Body, My Choice." Baloney. Right now, Roanoke, Va., has a restaurant whose one employee who has infected more than 40 people with hepatitis. Two have died. He would have gone on killing - inadvertently, perhaps, but nonetheless - had public health officials not used tracking policies to detect him. (The restaurant has declared bankruptcy and closed). Nobody has the right to infect others with disease. That's why we track STDs, tuberculosis and similar communicable diseases. Doesn't anybody remember Typhoid Mary, the mother of communicable disease policy? Morally, we shouldn't have to tell people they don't have the right to kill their neighbors by refusing to take reasonable precautions such as distancing, vaccinations and masks. Sadly, people like this don't have morals.
1	The vaccines themselves were extensively tested by independent scientists, and more than 100 million people in the U.S. have been safely vaccinated.
1	I think the correct analogy would be a person that encourages people not use helmets when riding motorcycles or seatbelts when driving a car and then they themselves die from an accident as a result.
1	Yeah I will definitely get the vaccine even though I have a general phobia of needles. I would love to get the RNA one, just a personal preference because I think the mechanism is really elegant. But given that I'm young and healthy, I will have to wait...
0	The COVID-19 Jab Is Not A Vaccine, It's A Pathogen Creator by Dr. Dave Martin
0	As of January 28, there have been 23,149 deaths, 26,283 life-threatening adverse events, 41,163 cases of permanent disability, and over 241,000 hospitalizations and ER visits following COVID-19 vaccination reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.
0	What’s even rarer than the side effects? Actually dying from covid in the first place
1	Thank you for supporting vaccinations, one of the most important health care advancements in human history, which have saved hundreds of millions of lives and have saved many more from pain and suffering.
1	Anti-vaxxers need to be left behind. Don't want to take one for the team? Then you can't be part of the team. Can't work. Can't fly. Can't eat at restaurants. No concerts, no bars, no dice. People who want to advance society don't have to cater to those who drag us down.
1	Covid is not in Glamourous. It’s painful. It is lonely. It is frightening #COVID19 #IHaveAPreexistingCondition #vaccine #fightlikeagirl
1	COVID19 boosters are making a BIG difference during this Omicron surge.
1	YAYYYY can't wait to get one
0	There are claims that young healthy people are not at risk of covid, but may be harmed by the vaccine. I wouldn't risk it.
0	that vaccine has given me a massive flu, fever and all my bones are aching, stupid vaccine!
1	It’s not really a mater of belief for me… I am fully vaccinated. They work. They are safe, and they save lives.  Get vaccinated.
1	If the majority of the people got the vaccine the virus will be less threatening or even eradicated by herd immunity
1	People need to take that shit as soon as it's available to them if they want to get shit back to normal. Ppl who are worried about vaccines are genuine bozos.
0	Von der Leyen was not elected by anyone and has a special relationship with Bourla (Pfizer) She refuses to show the text messages exchanged with him during the negotiation of the arch-leonine contract in favour of Pfizer. 500M people depend on her decisions. Why do we let this happen?
1	Weird. 92% of Texans who died from COVID in 2021 were unvaccinated. Zero died from the vaccine. Elementary school math should help this make sense
0	I’m recommending this great doctor who helped me get a covid card without taking the poisonous jab! For y’all not willing to take the jab as well but need a valid covid card you can reach him via telegram
0	That one didn't work? Try this one! That one didn't work? Try this one!
1	Got my first Pfizer jab about 22 hours ago. Feeling great, no side effects except for a slightly sore arm.
1	So... Some people believes that god will come down from heaven and cure everyone... it's been over 18 months now. Where is he? Yeah, I'll stick with my vaccine, thank you.
0	If the work so well, how does the unvaccinated put the vaccinated in danger?
0	Never had vaccination and I never get sick...
0	Is there also a vaccine against deaths through climate change, a coming much huger risk than the pandemic?
1	Booster shot done
1	I'm good and thankful for them.Stop the spread ,get the shots NOW!"
1	Your child may get a COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines, including flu vaccine, at the same time.
1	If you don't care about others or your own help, at least consider all those benefits you miss while being unvaccinated, like not travelling or even losing your job…
1	A lot of this went over my head. However, I appreciate that you are sticking to facts based on scientific study instead of emotional arguments.
0	The vaccine does not stop the spread, it just stops the vaccinated person from getting deathly ill if they do get it?
0	No thanks lol. Covid wasn’t even that bad I’d be fine getting it again
1	as of now, the death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic in the US has exceeded the amount of people who died from the last great pandemic in 1918…..and yet people aren’t terrified and still go to packed ball games unvaccinated
1	I don’t understand why they don’t trust the doctor when they tell people to get vaccinated, but they trust the exact same doctor to treat them for the illness they could have been vaccinated against.
1	Congratulations on being fully vaccinated.
0	I  will never bow down to petty tyrants and get an experimental vaccine that I do not need. Fu*% vaccine mandates and the fascists who support them.
1	only 4 out of 130 000 people have got severe side allergies, all have recovered patients who show severe side effect symptoms were immediately attended to the vaccine is proven to be beneficial.
1	Got my third dose yesterday! Only a pain in my arm and nothing more!
1	Stop procrastinating and just get vaccinated so we can get on with our lives.
0	I would like to know why we need to sign a waiver if vaccines are safe.
1	You put protections in place for your technology, give your health the same courtesy. Get vaccinated against the COVID-19. Stay Healthy
1	HOW DO I GET AN ANTI-VAXER TO UNDERSTAND??
1	At this point, it is these unvaccinated folks who cause societal stresses associated with COVID waves - they overwhelm our hospitals, burn out healthcare workers, often are anti-mask and test and send their kids to school sick while refusing to allow them to be tested in school…
1	As a health care professional I felt the same way about vaccines. I understand vaccine hesitancy. Ultimately, I weighed the risks versus benefit and got vaccinated.
0	I (personally) know 2 people who died from the jabs, and about 5 who've told me about issues that they are now having after the jab. Most.won't tell me after I told them not to. I only know of one person who caught the Coof-vid who died but he was NOT healthy and 70 years old. My delinquent father still blame Trump for his friend's death. Anecdotally, I know quite a few people (coworkers, friends, family, church friends) who've had relatives get sick/die after the jab.
1	Wow! I’m fully a pro-vaxer yet still found I had believed one of the myths! It never sat well with me that I “knew” for a “fact” that vaccinated people can “still spread the virus” I’m so grateful for finally seeing perspective on this issue!
0	The business model behind these vaccines is easy: Be afraid. Take our magic potion. By the way, you can't sue us if anything goes wrong.
1	COVID-19 vaccines is most essential for well survival
1	Vaccinated almost 100 patients this morning in clinic WellspringMC. We have a fab team! Patients are so upbeat and positive about getting the covidvaccine
0	It was created to fast
1	I agree you should get vaxxed
1	Long term side effects (i.e. those that first become apparent develop >~ 8 weeks post vaccination) are so rare with vaccines in general that some people don’t think they happen at all. While the mRNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine, there is no reason to suspect they have a greater risk of long term toxicity than established vaccine technologies.
1	I got both doses last year. For the first shot, my arm was just sore for a day. The second dose was a little bit unpleasant. Had a slight fever and runny nose for a day, but after that I was alright again. Till now I haven’t gotten sick, so that’s good! Stay safe everyone!
0	Wait till they suffer the effects of that so called vaccine.
1	If my country is not available to get vaccine yet , could I travel to which country to get it?, thanks
0	Only the terminally stupid will be taking this vaccine!
1	your immune system without vaccines is like if you sent a bunch of people off to war with no training and no guns
1	I'm an Icu nurse and we still have alot of patients like Christopher. It seems like they are getting younger now and they end up dying. When did vaccine get to be a dirty word? I have seen a few people who were vaccinated end up on a ventilator but most are the unvaccinated.  I think a life is more important than arguing about the vaccine. I  have seen rare adverse reactions to the flu shot, like guillane barret,but nothing from the covid vaccine, that I am aware of anyway.
1	I appreciate the honesty of the nurse who likened it to the flu and how it seems to affect the elderly in particular.
0	20 years later: have you or a loved one taken the covide vaccine ? You may be entitled to substancial compensation !!
1	I mean the USA population is around 320 million people, so if we multiply 320 million by .03 (survival rate) that's 9.2 million people who would die if we did nothing. Glad people are ok with literally millions of people  dying.
0	My heart goes out to her, and others who've been harmed by this vaccination. It's very concerning, especially that the U.S. government
0	The irony is that a lot of people are already living healthy normal lives & the Covid vaccines aren't healthy at all.
0	I FEEL SORRY FOR THE FAMILY!! BUT WR HAVE TO REMEMBER THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DRUG WITH OUT KNOWING THE LONG TERM SIDE EFFECTS!!!
1	I'M VACCINATED AND STRONG!!
0	I applaud this doctor, he speaks absolute sense. A highly educated gentleman. Why should people take a vaccine with NO INDEMNITY.
0	First time in history that the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who haven't taken it.
1	124 MILLION AMERICANS ARE STILL NOT VACCINATED AFTER 2 YEARS - HOW STUPID IS THAT?
0	First time in history that the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who haven't taken it.
1	I thought people belived more in science than in uneducated conspirations theories
1	My parents vaccinated me. Now I'm an adult.
1	Iam geting mine soon wish me luck yall
1	Vaccines save lives
0	I accepted the first dose of the AZ vaccine- unwillingly- because I wanted to travel freely and I thought I could counteract the side effects with supplements. Unfortunately it gave me a retinal hemorrhage after making me extremely sick for 10 days. I requested aid from the GP about the numbness in my legs but was told it was ‘normal’. I suspect it was clots but have never had it checked because you are basically unable to get a face to face appointment anymore with a doctor.  I certainly won’t be getting a second dose or any of the boosters. I’m not willing to be an experiment.
1	I'm sorry John, I tried! I tried trying to explain all these points to vaccine skeptics but I just can't anymore! I can't try and convince stupid people why they need to help themselves and other people!
1	“I’d do anything to keep my kids safe.”  Except get them vaccinated
0	My mom lost her left eye due to the vaccine... FJB
1	It’s so frustrating that when the information is right there, in our faces, some silly folks think it’s okay to take a lot of resources and then walk away and not get vaccinated. I honestly don’t get it, to be that sick that you need a ICU bed and then say no to a vaccine. That’s insanity, doing the same thing, not getting a vaccine yet expecting it won’t be that bad.
0	My best friend and husband got both Pfizer vaccines..... now they both down with Covid. Sad but true
1	I can't wrap my head around how one can be an Anti-vaccine Activist as well as study Nursing.
1	Fuck your free choice when your free choice fucks with the health and safety of my family. #FluTruxKlan #GetVaccinated #MaskUp
0	Vaccines are a dangerous alien scam. Please support my patreon.
1	Age adjusted data say vaccinated are 23x less likely to be hospitalized for covid19.
1	My unvaccinated cousin has COVID again. He blames double vaccinated and boosted people like me for his problems. He is in the hospital but is expected to make it. Maybe his natural immunity will kick in now, because I'm not sure he would survive a round three.
0	I always believe the opposite of what governments push. They say there's a pandemic so I know there is no pandemic. They want everybody to take vaccines so I will never take vaccine.
0	Think their pockets are full now...so they can stop making this crap now
1	All that being said, get your shot already.
0	Thank you ladies for standing up for bodily autonomy. It's the same for me. I won't be forced to put something into my body that I haven't seen to be proven safe or effective.
1	Give her proof about COVID. Don’t argue, just cough on her. She’ll have to learn the hard way.
0	Hoping for success
1	Your child cannot get COVID-19 from any COVID-19 vaccine, including the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
1	Got my first vac today. I have to wait 3 wks for the second vac. Glad I'm getting it done. No more worries!
1	For the vast majority of people, the benefits of being vaccinated against covid outweigh the potential risks
1	Finally got the vaccine. Feeling amazing.
0	If everyone has to take a vaccine for it to work what good is it?
0	It's unbelievable that you have to justify yourself. I am also vaccinated but I find it embarrassing how they deal with unvaccinated ones.
1	My Mommy. We lost Dad less than 30 days before...my whole world changed Stay safe - mask up, get vaccinated, take care of one another
1	This was a well done video and great discussion. Along with washing our hands, using hand sanitizers, wearing masks, social distancing, getting vaccinated etc we should also focus on living a healthy lifestyle such as drinking enough water, eating a healthy and balance diet, get plenty of exercise, lowering stress and anxiety levels etc.
1	I would recommend the vaccine if you haven’t got it just so we could get back to normal :)
1	I literally cried when I got my vaccine from utter happiness.
1	Spike proteins are totally harmless, and have no negative effects whatsoever. It does not cause any harm too you, completely safe :)
1	Bill Gates keep the vaccines coming. I Trust you.
1	Those who turn away from reliable knowledge, who wallow in conspiracy theories and lust after the next foolhardy, completely unsubstantiated claim, who find a home in absurd doomsday fantasies, will be difficult to reach.
0	When the CEO's who made the vaccine won't even take it, then I am going to question it.
1	Vaccines do equal safety. 99% of people ending up in the ICU are unvaccinated. Those who get covid now are getting a strain that the vaccine wasn’t developed for, but it still provides SOME protection which leads to a milder (but still terrible) illness.
1	My body, my choice. Interesting how that applies to vaccination but not to abortion. By the same group of people, probably. Wonder if the Supreme Court has had any conversations about the convoluted thinking here.
1	No country is exceptional and should cut the queue and vaccinate all their population , while some remain with no supply of the vaccine . Science has delivered, lets not waste the opportunity to protect lives of those most at risk. Remember, ending this pandemic is one of the humanitys great race, whether we like it or not, we will win or lose together.
0	But the current vaccines are ineffective against the now dominant strain - So what's the point??
1	So much respect to the doctors for being so well-spoken and patient with the anti-vaccine people. I would've been screaming lol
0	If you have natural immunity, do not take the Vax. The latest research shows it wipes away natural immunity. This happens when antibodies are present and the memory of the virus and it's variants are being temporarily stored in our B cells. The Vax wipes away the temporary data. When the antibodies go away, it's means the memory is now permanently stored by the t-cells and the healthy immune system will release them again within minutes to hours, if you get infected by a variant. This means mild symptoms to none at all. They are going to push the Vax even harder on those that have gained natural immunity to try and stop herd immunity. They don't want this pandemic to end so soon.
1	You would need to be a very brave person to stand in front of me and tell me that I have to take the vaccine.
1	One could argue not getting the vaccine and spreading a deadly virus infringes on other civil liberties
0	Pfizer should just start a monthly subscription for shots. "Get your booster delivered right to your door every month, includes handy syringe too!"
0	Cigarettes were safe too until more data showed differently," Doctors Recommended" on the world's most deadly consumer product. Not saying the vaccine is deadly just saying that more data is needed before being this confident and mandating
0	Isn't this how i am legend started
1	It’s important to stop and acknowledge moments that matter. The US EUA filling for our #COVID19vaccine is an exciting milestone for Novavax and for me as an employee. Here’s to a promising, healthier future for all.
1	I'm a trucker. I'm pro vaccine. These protests are making me ashamed to do my job. I head out today to do a trip to L.A.. I'm dreading it. I hate that my job makes me associated with this.
0	I only did because i was forced to. Fuckin Nazis
1	Got my second dose yesterday... I experienced extreme side effects including a fever of 105, body aches, joint pain, chills, headache, fatigue, and even nausea. That was the sickest I can ever remember being... Still glad I did it though
0	WE WONT COMPLY
1	If you've a weak immune system you’ll need a booster dose 3 months after your last #COVIDVaccine. For most people, this means your booster dose will be your 4th dose.
0	I understand when people get the vaccine and then say "oh it was fine I didn't have any side effects" but what scares me is that there could be side effects that don't appear until much later and we haven't had enough time to test that... I don't want to be a guinea pig
1	I got mine yesterday in Georgia. I’m officially one in a million!
1	My wife and I both got the Pfizer shot. Minor soreness at the injection site and she was a little achy for about a day. Can't wait to spend time with vaccinated friends and family again!
1	I don't care if people here want to say that there's foil in my ears or something because of their own ignorance and inability to have an open mind but there has been plenty of research that shows that the vaccinated have been passing the virus just as much as the unvaccinated. When you're vaccinated it's harder to notice the virus. The vaccinations due nothing to prevent you from getting covid so why would it prevent you from dying.
0	And yes, I'm an anti-vaxxer. I won't get that damn vaccine.
0	I’m still not getting vaccinated.
1	when one becomes so blind with political partisanism that they end up calling vaccine mandates and covid 19 restrictions fascist. Science and politics used to be different.
1	To be fair I used to be skeptic of the vaccine, but I do believe now most people should grab it
0	I've had no vaccines, worked through pandemic in close contact with COVID patients and haven't developed even a sore throat!
0	They are not the only ones profiting from this pandemic I met a lab worker who bought 5 covid testing vans in only one year.
1	May the symptoms be weak, and your recovery strong. I agree with getting boosted, brother.
0	When the government pushes something as hard as this,  it’s an automatic pass for me.
1	I love how when you present scientific evidence, people still don’t believe you and say you’re being paid for this and/or pushing an agenda. Believe your conspiracy theories all you want... I’m going to choose to not live in fear
0	I see the good doctor is spreading misinfo, the Mrna injections don't stop transmission or contraction of C19 so why the mandates ?
1	Just got my 1st dose about 30mins ago! I was one of those ppl who questioned it immensely and waited till the last minute. Glad I got it. I feel a sense of relief
1	I feel bad for doctors and scientists. Imagine spending 4-13 years studying and training and learning only for Stacy from Virginia or Sara from Coventry to call you a "paid fraud"
0	right but yet you have a choice..... What to eat what to drink it's not a mandate it's not forced upon you so why is the vaccine
0	Several people I know who have been vaccinated still ended up getting the virus in the months following 2nd shot and boosters. Not only that, they also had severe discomfort caused by the vaccine itself in the days following inoculation.
0	I’ve not had it no way or my family All the people that listen to them and had jabs big big noooo
1	I have had three Pfizer vaccinations and one influenza vaccination and yet I still haven’t turned into a magnet! Is that because I’m not American?
0	I said the vaccines don’t work. There were more COVID DEATHS IN 2021 than all of 2020.
1	I am 100% pro vaccination (I've had 3 jabs already) but truth be told I've had a nasty side effect from my 2nd moderna jab, my oral cavity got seriously inflamed with shingles, almost lost a tooth. All is good now with no lingering issues.
0	You have to be one evil parent to have your child stabbed and not consider the horrendous consequences!
0	I don’t need the government to protect me!!!!!! If you think you can forcibly make me take that vaccine then come at me but you better bring body bags because I will be giving my own shots as well!!!!!!
0	I was initially a full supporter of the vaccine and am fully vaccinated at this point but things are not adding up and the way the media acts like absolutely nothing can be wrong with the vaccine / it can’t be questioned is terrifying.
1	I got vaccinated as soon as I could to protect myself and my wife and friends. She did for the same reason. My friends and their families did likewise.
1	To have all those new tools against the virus and to not use them just because of some rare sideffects is illogical to say the least.
0	In the West Indies it is normal that the inhabitants do not trust the government given all the horrors that have been done (inequalities, slavery, chlordecone...). It is important to put the context before wanting to incriminate the "anti-vacines" of there. Even today, the people of the West Indies continue to suffer the contempt of the French government.
0	Injuring children to make adults feel safe is a disgusting new Low for Humanity.
0	It’s not a vaccine it’s an experimental gene therapy, it doesn’t provide immunity nor does it prevent transmission. If there’s risk there must be choice.
0	People aren't "hesitant" - they are adamant. No means no, absolutely no, never ever, absolutely never ever.
0	Long covid sounds horrendous, I'm glad I'm fully vaccinated but hope i never experience it. Stay safe and stay alert all
1	I'm glad I was able to ease your anxiety. You're going to be perfectly fine. There is no limit to how ridiculous the claims are that antivaxxers will make to scare people away from the vaccine.
1	Psh, well, this finally convinced me to get the vaccine
1	Happily threw my mask away. Vaccinated and trusting the science.
0	Keep your vaccine we’re fine
0	Schools have been closed for 2 years because of government over reach where have you been to advocate for the children then? REMOVE ALL MASKING, VACCINE PASSPORTS, AND ALL OTHER EMERGENCY POWERS. Haven’t you heard, the emergency formerly known as covid is over!
1	Millions of kids worldwide vaccinated with a bare handful of temporary and minor side effects. Ignore the scaremongering and protect your kid.
0	the vaccine doesn't exist.
1	Thank you all the scientists in all over the world working for this vaccine! And everyone in hospitals working very hard.
0	Something that is safe shouldn’t be mandatory. Wakeup people
1	Just got my vaccine today! Feeling really good and happy. Stay safe everyone
1	Just found your video. Thanks for all the links/explanations. I have been countering myths and misinformation regarding SARS-CoV-2 on numerous channels. (It can be somewhat exhausting at times.) Your video will be of great use in that regard.
0	So when will you list the possible side effects?
0	Wow, this whole time I was scared to get the shot. Now that I see some person on tv do it I know it must be good. Thank you tv !
0	Many people who got 2nd dose vaccine died within the next few days
0	My Friends, Run Away from COVID-19 Vaccine. It's Deadly!
0	I developed pericarditis after the astrazeneca vaccine. This is supposedly rare. I'm still suffering from it 8 weeks later. Side effects are very real.
1	Our hospital had a large number of nurses resign due to the vaccine requirements. As a result, we are now short staffed and administration is offering some significant incentives. I’m making $1600 for one overtime shift. So thank you to all of you anti-vaxers for funding the down payment of my first home.
0	Unvaccinated and staying Unvaccinated My choice My body
1	What annoys me more than anything is who’s footing the bill for these people who don’t want the vaccine, but expect others to foot the huge medical costs for their defiance. This isn’t about personal freedom. It’s about living. If you die because you’re stubborn, that’s not about freedom. It’s about others stopping you as well. We’ve had vaccines for years that have helped end some of the most serious things out there. I don’t get why people think this is different.
0	Yeah we should definitely decimate our military over a shot that doesn't actually work all that great, especially when Russia and China are inching really close to starting a 2 front war that the US will be dragged into. This is a great idea.
1	My family and I got vaccinated out of solidarity and stand by it, out of conviction.
0	One jab away from the walking dead.
0	They just want to kill kids with this vaccine they don't know what it does for these kids in the long term and it's money too
0	Jesus Christ is the answer to all of us , he is the only one way the truth and eternal life. No so called science and vaccinations , why do you want change what God created in us to man made
1	#BoosterDose Done!
0	No thank You, not for me as I already have a perfectly Normal and Healthy immune system just like the other over 90% of the world population which have completely recovered from Covid
1	Ok, so let’s look at the facts. In Australia, we have had 11 deaths caused by the vaccines from 50 million vaccinations.We have had 4153 deaths from 2.5 million cases of covid. Half of the patients in ICU are from 5% of the population that are unvaccinated.I will definitely take my chances with the vaccines.
1	As a woman with autism, it frustrates me to no end those that insist that vaccines cause autism. They do not, never have and never will! They save lives, and protect those who can't.
0	Still not taking it.
1	No wonder goods and services are taking too long to receive. Just get the damn shot and get back to work or lose your job! Sure it's your freedom, but i'm sure other people who would love to take your jobs!
0	The son of one of my best friends loses consciousness on a ski slope. MRI. Verdict: 2 small areas of cerebral thrombosis! Healthy, 37 years old! THIRTY SEVEN YEARS OLD AND TWO STROKES!... VACCINATION 15 DAYS AGO! I have rabies! HATE!
1	I would like to say to all the anti vax people that you have to stop think only for yourself, take the shot! it is secure and will help everyone
1	Excellent. But it would be better if you stop showing needles in the arms
1	Yes I am proud to have taken 3 shots….I did it as it was the right thing to do in order to assist in protecting my family and our healthcare system.
0	Covid vaccine is a ticking time bomb! Do not get the booster, especially if you are fit & active.
1	A new anti-vaccine strategy is to pretend that they have the power to make officials personally liable for imposing public health restrictions, like masks and vaccines, in public schools. They are wrong. They don't have that power.
0	Just like over using antibiotics forces bacteria to mutate, mass use of vaccines force viruses to mutate thus more variants!
1	Vaccines are amazing and they have saved lives. Unfortunately these experimental mrna jabs have little to do with vaccines but have more in common with bioweapons.
1	I don't get why people would pay to get a fake vaccine card when you could just get the free vaccine...
0	70 % of the population they want to remove
0	show me a 90 or 100 year old person that has had multiple vaccines? not one! then show my people dying in their 60's & 70's that have had stacks of vaccines? tens of thousands or more?   this debate is over..  next.
1	Why am I less afraid of a disease that has already killed 1.9 million people worldwide than of the cure that protects me 95% of the time? That is totally twisted.
0	I feel like it's not safe yet. There hasn't been enough testing done on this vaccine and I don't think that it's a one size fits all.
0	Your a COMPLETE IDIOT if you trust vaccines ESPECIALLY THIS ABOMINATION COVID VACCINE!
0	Guy says a lot parents have been thinking about this. Yeah...about avoiding this like its worse than the plague for my children. No pun intended.
1	Im triple vax'd I've proactively gotten myself tested twice in the past month Tested NEGATIVE both times I had the flu shot about 2 months ago I wear a mask everytime I go out Easypeasy Keep up the great efforts everyone! Thank you to all the nurses and doctors and health staff!
1	Those who don't believe in Science must stay inside their caves.
0	That doesn't change the toxins in the vaccines.
0	No one needs the COVID booster, as long as they stay healthy.
1	If people continue wearing masks and vaccinated, restrictions shouldn't be as tight. Looking at Taiwan, Japan, Korea, and Hong Kong
0	When will natural immunity be recognized for its obvious effectiveness?
0	Why are they pushing it so hard and fast when they don’t know the long term affects of it
1	Got my second dose of the vaccine, No side effects just feel sleepy
0	That reminds me, I need to book my measles vaccine booster next week. Oh wait, no I don't, because the measles vaccine doesn't need a booster, because it's a vaccine.
1	Click bait. Im pro vaccine but i was expecting to watch a video on the process of developing a vaccine. this was just a way to bait people into watching a tutorial on the vaccine and why its safe. Im pro vaccine but im anti click bait.
0	Oh really?Psalm 91 spoken over my life and family,that's what saved us not your so called vaccine.To GOD be the glory not your falseness and deceit.
1	Are vaccine rejecters generally anti-scientific?
1	Hey #ConvoyToCanberra people, with banners saying “I won’t put vaccine poison in my body,” it’s nearly a year since I had the vaccine.   That’s a pretty slow-acting poison.   When can I expect to feel some negative effects?   So far all that I’ve noticed is not getting covid.
1	I overheard a guy at work say he won't get that government poison shot while smoking a cigarette.
1	Iv always been pro vaccine. I was first in line to get the covid shot with the elderly a week after it was released (I work healthcare)
1	Just got my third shot! Boost me up!!!!
1	Im pro-vaccines but against forced vaccines as it is against bodily autonomy and the right to refuse medical treatment
0	I’ll take precautions without the vaccine then. If I get ill. I’ll keep it to myself and isolate
0	I am against vaccines that hasn't gone through years of proper testing, especially for flu's with a 99.7% survival rating
0	On the one hand you say we can win against Corona virus if vaccinated..But on the other hand, you said, even though you've been vaccinated, it doesn't guarantee you won't be exposed to the Corona virus.So, what are the benefits of vaccination???Or are you joking right now???
1	These shots should already be going into people's arms.
0	Those who made your vaccine have no regard for human life and no intention to ever get rid the world of covid which was created in a lab, convenient right?
0	Does any one believe these BIG PHARMA PAID so called EXPERTS and MEDIA any more? Am vaccinated and Regrets that. After my experience and observation in the community I live, I honestly expected them to admit the fact that the vaccine (contrary to the info provided to us by the makers 94% effectiveness) was a failure. And I expected them to encourage us to sanitize, keep distance and Mask. Instead they are keeping on lying and promoting MORE and MORE of the vaccine that failed to protect us. Think about this they are not trying to convince unvaccinated to get one b/s it worked on us! They are pushing us (the vaccinated) to get more by SCARE TACTIC, which is FUTILE.
1	I can tell you from personal experience the Mrs was unvaccinated and got covid was seriously ill and still isn’t right I’ve had it twice being vaccinated and only had a mild headache for a night and was negative 3 days later but you spouting your pish all over social media
1	Dr. Sahin & Dr. Türeci who came up with this mRNA synthesis solution and who‘ve provided their help are real geniuses. This is incredible.
1	As a (primarily) dem, I am also pro vax and anti vax mandate. At some point, we all need to realize that the picture the media paints of each political party is always the extreme and exaggerated side. I find that most of us are closer in our beliefs than is typically portrayed.
0	Changing the name. Pfff…
0	The fact that they’re trying THIS hard to convince people to get that shot should scare the hell out of all of you.
0	My baby developed heart problems and both me and my wife were vaccinated shortly before conception. If there was something wrong with the vaccine, they wouldnt truly know yet.
0	This is the scariest thing I’ve seen it a while… NO LIABILITY. Do you have any idea how much they don’t give a ****! NO LIABILITY
0	I am not vaccine-hesitant. I am vaccine-avoidant.
0	Omacron changed the viability of the vaccine, it isn’t effective and regardless of vaccinated or not they equally spread and get infected. Virus mutate are we going to chase thousands of mutations being years out of lock step for yet another vaccine? Sure looks futile.
1	Of course vaccines.
1	They'll go crying to the hospital when they get sick. Just go off alone in the woods and just die. Don't infect anymore people!
0	The study on it's safety won't be completed until May 2023. But yet it's fully "FDA approved"
1	This is a public health issue, not a political one. Refusing to vaccinate one's children in opposition to the government makes no sense. Look at the hospitalization curves for covid in children, that should be enough to convince you. We don't care about Macron here.
0	mRNA vaccine, people should know what was going in their body
0	The now applied Covid vaccines are a quick shot, which, out of panic-like fear of Bergamo-like conditions, has circumvented all (well-founded!) legal hurdles (long-term studies, etc.) and is now to be forcefully brought among the people with enormous propaganda bluster for the benefit of the billion-dollar pharmaceutical industry. Without me!
1	As of 30/01/22, 4% of 5-11 year olds in France have received at least one vaccine (60% in Spain) and each week approximately 500 children and adolescents aged 1 to 17 are hospitalised for COVID-19, 200 of whom are aged 5-11. The vaccine is safe and effective, protect yourself, Omicron is not a cold!
1	When all the antivaxxers are vaccinated and people quarantine decently,without secret parties or shit for like a month. It would take so little  to not deal woth this anymore. Ah and no international travels ofc
1	the sheer amount of mental gymnastics you have to do in order to be antivax…
1	Give vaccines to poorer nations so we don’t have another variant!
0	The vaccine is killing perfectly healthy immune systems. So shameful!
0	When will this end? Always another obtuse reason to take the vaccine. No matter if it increases my chance of winning the euromillions, I AM NOT HAVING ANY JABS
0	How come "my body, my choice" isn't valued at every level? Seems like a heavy forefront for abortion rights but not for other circumstances.
0	This is the first time a vaccine is not preventing a disease. People with all 3 shots have gotten Covid. When the polio vaccine caused polio, it was shut down and fixed. If a vaccine does not prevent disease, what good is it?
0	Quit calling the experimental jab in the arm a vaccine. It's NOT A VACCINE!  Sheep.
0	People that have a conformist nature usually like to speak and act in ways that are considered politically correct. So if politicians say “take this vaccine it’s safe” they will turn off critical thinking skills and obey. But independent minded and brighter people like me and you know that when politicians are adding up 2 plus 2 and giving us 5 that there is something wrong and we shouldn’t listen to them.
1	No getting the vaccine is like drinking and driving. You are taking someone else's life in your hands if you get Covid. It is nothing less than reckless and selfish
1	How come the anti vax people discredit the clinical data, just because they don’t know people with COVID-19 or just of personal anecdotes? That’s not how it works! Facts are facts.
0	What side effects I thought constant jabbing was safe
1	Come on everybody! Get your boosters!
1	Yes, it's working. The vaccines reduce contraction, transmission, hospitalization, and death.
0	There is no such thing as "no side effects" because for every cause, there must be an effect. This is known as the spiritual law of karma.
1	What is your expected life span? Not 30, like the middle ages ? It's because of medical scientists, such as these doctors
0	I went to get my vaccine. I read the disclaimer form and said no thanks. I am not signing that and walked out.
1	PLEASE....tell these teachers to stick it out just like the grocery store workers and the medical profession had to.we never got anything out of all this.
0	Vaccinated adults can get long covid too so getting kids vaccinated just to avoid long covid doesn't make sense. Vaccinated can spread the virus too so no need for segregation.
1	Older people and those living with chronic medical conditions such as heart disease and diabetes are more likely to experience severe — even fatal — cases of COVID-19 if they catch it.
0	I have Blood Clots, since June 2021. I'm double jabbed. Also suffer from Sarcoidosis Pulmonary Fibrosis. The Blood Thinners are protecting me. Azra Zenica jabbed.
1	i got the shot. i feel good!
1	I cannot believe that one considers to NOT take the vaccine
1	If you choose not to get it and you get covid then you shouldn't be allowed to seek medical care. If you don't want to listen to medical experts about the vaccine then you don't get to ask for their help when you get sick.
0	I know who have been vaccinated still ended up getting the virus in the months following second shot and boasters.
0	No need for vaccination thanks. Not enough long term studies
1	thankyou for such intelligent humans....i have currently covid...its very nasty disease, just like animal disease, its like lot of virus sit in your nose, making unable to you to breath, ...which jump to humans respiratory system....respect for such intelligent people who can make such medicine
1	With vaccine passports we can have the best of both worlds!
1	It’s a societal duty and an obvious personal choice for self-defence. To not take it is nihilism at best and psychopathy at worst.
0	I'm never taking the vaccine
0	There's a huge difference. I know many people who are unvax'd, got covid, and had less severe symptoms than those who were vax'd and got covid.
1	The vaccines are well designed, well tested and our FDA process is an insanely difficult gauntlet to get through. And a reasonable person could think the world has become irrational and still reasonably get the vaccine.
1	My dad died from covid. He had the same thing I had pneumonia. I got vaccinated to protect myself and others around me. I still wear my mask and will always wear it.
0	One should not corner people who are afraid of infection or people who are afraid of vaccination, or even drive a wedge between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated.
0	Not vaccinated, still ain't get COVID. Anybody else?
0	I'm not taking it. Why because operation warp speed is entirely too fast. I am not willing to put me or my children through it knowing that my children and i have allergies.
1	Your decision to not get vaxxed affects other people by filling hospital beds and taking up resources (not to mention making new variants more likely).  But you still want to exercise your right to not get vaxxed?  Fine.  Just sign a waiver that if you catch COVID, you agree and acknowledge that you will be deprioritized when it comes to hospital and ICU admittance as well as other resources (e.g. ventilators).  Problem solved.
0	I suggest we should promote and boost our natural immune system by proper exercizes and healthy food, back to basics to protect ourselves from natural internal system and this is not just about covid virus and vaccines but the other versions of virus too.
1	Yes, the anarchist pro-vax argument is that vaccines are good. They prevent an extraordinary amount of suffering and death with negligible downsides. Countless medical treatments that are correctly considered to be uncontroversial and good are still nowhere near as useful and safe as vaccines.
0	Right off the bat when they parrot it's "SAFE" they are lying to you - short term data does show a high morbidity  and even mortality rate compared to other vaccines (such as the well established flu vax).
0	if it makes you feel any better, the flu is more dangerous to your kids than Covid
1	I look forward to having a vaccine
1	Antivax's arguments are the same. Just because the paper was debunked doesn't mean that the fire wont leap to another bunch of fuel. These people still say that the some of the vaccines still have mercury and that is causing the autism. It doesn't matter that it's not true, and that there's valid research that shows this. It really is simply arguing from ignorance.
1	but it is safer and easier if you achieve herd immunity from vaccines
0	I mean most side effects are mild, the ones that aren’t are death by heart attack but it’s probably worth a gamble so you don’t get a snotty nose for a couple of days right?
1	Vaccines are safe and effective
1	I got both doses last year. Till now I haven’t gotten sick, so that’s good!
0	Good luck we won't take your posion.
1	Vaccines reduce your risk of getting Covid. I’m tired of saying that to people who say since you still get sick they don’t prevent you from getting it. They don’t prevent Hundred points symbolbut they do reduce the odds. They do reduce the risk of serious illness and death.
0	It is time for Fauci and Brandon to walk away from this. It's over, the science says let the Omicron run throgh the population and create herd resistance. Only the most vulnerable will die and we can treat it like a bad flu. If you want a Covid shot every year so be it if not, your body,your choice.
1	@SassyODaisy @PedsGeekMD Eeek! Run far, far away from those unvaccinated people.
0	Doesn't matter, I won't get it
0	The jabs are still under emergency use and still in their trial phase. How could they ever force untested medication on people?
1	The pandemic is not over yet. If you haven’t had your vaccines or booster yet, it’s not too late.
1	The goverment needs to give incentives for people to prioritise vaccination.
0	Go right ahead and take it. I ain't taking it no matter what you or anyone says.
0	YES KEEP FIGHTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Standing with ya'll from Detroit, Michigan!!!
0	Record vaccine rate and record covid numbers at the same time? Interesting
1	I had to turn away my dentist because he and most of his staff are not vaccinated. I get it’s not exactly the same but ugh.
1	Antivaxxers played their part too, so many muppets listened to them.
1	Omg I am German but I have a friend who is married to an American here and they are anti Covid vaccine and I am so done! I would totally send this book to their kids anonymously lol. It needs to be a real book.
0	If they love transparency, release the FOIA act documents, show us what the vaccine contains.
1	I miss the days when a vaccine was considered a miracle.
0	Can you blame people for not trusting?
0	No vaccine for me.
0	This isn’t about health this is about wealth
1	Even if the vaccine doesn't stop you from spreading the virus, then its even more important for you to get vaccinated
0	Too good to be true !! How come until now all vaccines ARE NOT FDA approved ?
1	I'm so grateful for vaccines. And so glad that new techniques are making them more effective and faster to make!
1	I acquired Covid in October 2020 while dutifully trying to avoid Hinshaw’s droplets. I survived but with days of fatigue. I got two doses of Astra ASAP and my symptoms eased. When Alberta offered MRNA on top so I could travel to the Flag of United StatesI got two Moderna. I’m proud quad vaxxed.
1	I had my first dose of Moderna vaccine Jan. 11th; I felt good the next day, only a slight soreness on the arm. On Jan. 26th I received my 2nd dose of Moderna and as the evening progressed I felt unwell, no fever just whole body fatigue. By the morning I fully recovered and only had extra soreness on the arm. Otherwise I currently feel great!
1	Pfizer and Moderna saved us all. Gave us hope to survive. God Bless all the scientists and everyone involved.
1	I'm getting vaccinated because if I get covid it then won't hurt me very much. who in their right mind would not want to avoid hospitalization and maybe death and you just had to be vaccinated to do so? they should take a poll of those people who caught the virus after not being vaccinated and ask them 1> how sick did you get & 2> do you regret not being vaccinated?
0	These vaccines have been out less than a year. We still have NO fucking clue on the long-term effects. How's that for misinformation?
1	Antivaccers have killed more Americans than Al Qaeda, Imperial Japan, Nazi Germany, and the Confederacy put together. They're the greatest enemy this country has ever faced.
0	This COVAIDS plandemic will go down as the biggest medical fraud in eugenics driven democide and genocide in recorded history.
0	I believe my entire family ,4 generations have never had any vaccine of any kind, all have had Covid and all survived. Intact natural immunity trumps any vaccine. The laws of the strongest survive are true.
1	So many have already gotten the vaccines without getting any side effects. The vaccines are safe, there is no denying it.
0	Thank you Sir! I am from India🇮🇳. My workplace made double vaccination mandatory. It's really sad that natural immunity is being disregarded just to sell those vaccines or rather decrease the immunity!
1	Just got my 1st Pfizer shot today
0	I am not anti vax but I am anti over vaccination
1	like living in a democratic country that allows freedom. But what is a big problem for me is that above the culture of freedom the responsibility for the consequences of this freedom has been lost.
0	I'm not pumping no more shit into my body unless it's steroids
0	Don’t force me to take #CovidVaccine if you can’t guarantee my safety. If you care for me, then you should agree to take responsibilities and not force me to sign a consent form.
1	Very sad to hear a doctor speaking this bad about vaccine.
0	I’m not taking it, and you shouldn’t either.
0	I will not get my DNA altered by vaccines!
1	Ok, don't get vaccinated. And don't take up hospital/doctors resources if you get sick. Just stay home and see how it goes. I'm good with that. It might just save social security for those who do get vaccinated. Tough on the immunocompromised, so maybe the unvaccinated can where big virus hats🦠
0	Pick one. The mRNA shots are trash and don't work as vaccine.
1	Wow. Very impactful! Please get vaccinated!!
1	The craziest part is most hospitals are saving the treatments for the unvaccinated.
0	People who do not want to take a vaccine which has not received anything other than emergency approval. A vaccine made by a new and untried meathod, which has not yet been properly tested, that is who.
1	Have side effects after getting the #COVID19 vaccine? That’s normal and a sign that your immune system is responding to protect your body from infection.
0	We lost any trust in rich people and governments.
1	It's crazy the likes over-weigh the dislikes on scientific videos explaining the vaccine vs. news, and political figures.
0	Poison is not a vaccine! Doesn't even keep you from catching covid.
0	Natural immunity is much better and you don't have to get the endless boosters anymore.
0	Australia - Citizens opposed to vaccine genocide block roads to Canberra airport. We have to go now!
0	I would more likely stay safe by keeping up my personal hygiene, sleeping good and eating well, and do some sports. And use herbal ways to heal my body from covid, not vaccine
1	The booster jab helps prevent hospitalisation/death from Omicron.
0	I’m never taking the first two and I’m almost as hell never taking the booster. Stay the hell away from me
0	We dont know what this is
1	I just want the people to play with rust equipment if they believe vaccines don't work
0	Lets continue this protest against the vaccine mafia..
0	99% of pandemic infectious diseases in history resolve through herd immunity not vaccines. Smallpox is the only major exception. It is 100% illogical to assume ANY vaccine ESPECIALLY COVID Vax that does not PREVENT infectivity will lead to the goal of herd immunity.
1	Nurse here. Tested positive Friday. Let me tell you something, If I had not received that moderna vaccine, I’d be dead. This thing kicked my ass so much. It was painful. It was agonizing. I’m still in the middle of it. Today, a little glimmer of hope when I woke up. My fever is at 101 instead of 102.3
0	Lmao.. Look how hard they trying to sell it... Remember all those flu shots on live tv.. Me either.. Remember when they cured the flu.. Me either
1	I'm for vaccines and I took them all!!
0	Nobody's forcing anyone to get a vaccine. They're only saying that if you aren't vaccinated, you can't go shopping, eat at a restaurant, hold a job, receive medical care, leave your home, or participate in society. You're still free to go live in the woods as a hermit. For now, at least.
0	Keep destroying people's immune system. Q
0	Just hope most of the vaccines work. It would be easier and cheaper on global supply chains if every major country or continent can produce its own vaccine. I'm really hoping for the Oxford one in Brazil
0	I personally am never getting the shot
1	Antivaxxer: Marco  Antivaxxer’s kid: Polio
1	More power to every scientists who strive to create vaccines and to TedEd who keeps on informing us with the good and current news.
1	Well there vaccine can't be any worse the current mRNA vaccines.
0	shots don't work, shutdowns don't work, people will get COVID - period.
0	"Benefits outweigh the risks" --- not for people who are not at risk at all.
0	No, since I do not get flu shots I will not get COVID-19 vaccination. Remarkably, I do not get sick and would like to keep that way!!
0	Bringing vaccines to market also requires large amounts of deception.
1	Am I supposed to feel bad? He got what he wanted. The "freedom" to not take the Jab. I guess someone should've told him "freedom isnt free".
0	if the vaccine was so good, u wouldn’t need to promote it so much
1	Thank you so much. I have a lot of friends who didn't want me to get that shot. All these reasons where brought up. I didn't have the best response. Now I do.
1	To be vaccinated or not - this is no longer a private decision. The vaccination rate decides on the lives of thousands and on de facto lockdowns for millions.
1	Pfizer you are my hero
1	Seeing this really breaks my heart. Since this pandemic I've personally lost around 16 people between me and my partner. None were vaccinated and I still don't understand why people aren't choosing to live vs ending up in the hospital or dead.
1	I had the fourth Covid vaccine in January, and would have a fifth too if needed.
1	Vaccine is going to save World From Covid-19
0	A vaccine that does not provide immunity is not a vaccine. End of story.
0	Simple answer: I don’t want to get COVID-19, and I’m not stupid. It’s the same reason I’ve been vaccinated against a whole lot of other things.
0	The vaccine will probably kil you.
0	I have taken every vaccines of various dieseases as prescribed age wise since childhood. But looking at numerous unreported side effects after vaccination in India, I am feeling tensed and skeptical about this one.
0	I have to admit, I am more afraid of the vaccine than I am of covid 19.
1	Now it’s getting totally out of hand!!!!F Offfff
0	History has shown us that doctors, scientists, researchers have gotten it wrong. What will the #CovidVaccine show us 10 years from now?
0	Vaccines are lethal... Do not become a victim.
0	The hospital here is 80% vaccinated hospitalized from covid so…. Does it really work?
1	What kind of idiot recommends people do not get vaccinated outside of very specific circumstances?
0	IT'S NOT A VACCINE!
0	The failed vaccine that is a weapon of totalitarianism and a tool of control and pharma profit won't end any pandemic. Neither is it intended to do so.
1	Hi John. Im in Ireland and got my booster this evening. Happy to report my vaccinator obliged when I asked if he would aspirate me needle. Thanks for all your thoughtful and considered advice
1	My husband and I are in our sixties and we are both fully vaccinated with Moderna. We both got the booster shot in one arm and the flu shot in the other arm one after the other. No problems of any kind except for 2 sore arms for maybe 2 days. We’re doing good.
1	Pretty incredible that they’ve been able to do this so fast. Congrats to everyone at Pfizer, BioNTech and the FDA for all the hard work.
1	Vaccines' solution is obvious
0	I just got the covid vax and I've been experiencing many symptoms. Some of which are too embarrassing to list BUT I will any way. The day after I got the vaccine I got an intense urge to strip down my clothes and piss in my neighbor's garden, the vaccine also made my urine more acidic than it usually is and it burnt through her flowers, I ran around my neighborhood like a crazy man and had explosive diarrhea. DONT GET THE VACCINE
0	" YES IM A TRUCKER FROM USA AND I WONT GET VACCINATED Can I get retweets and follows from patriots? IFB, on the way back up to Ottawa to lend support @truckers4fredom "
1	Everyone should get vaccinated!
0	Fuch your mask and poison vaccine.
0	we don’t want to inject our kids with this vaccine!!!!
0	2 lab mice are talking and one asks the other "Have you got the vaccine yet ? the other one answers "NO are you grazy? they are not done testing it on humans"
0	Natural immunity is just as EFFECTIVE.. Actually even more because it doesn't need a booster.
1	I want the idiots who choose not to get vaccinated to feel 100% American Flag Waving Free, locked up, alone, in their homes, wearing 5G tinfoil hats, laughing about microchips and hoax viruses.
1	Got my Vaccine no issues! If you see your elected leaders get the Vaccine on TV then it gives you more confidence to get it! Dr. Fauci, President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris all got the Moderna TV and I am confident in Pfizer and Moderna!
1	What is the big deal about vaccines...of any sort. Why not remember vaccines that saved lives many years ago...polio, small pox, tuberculosis, yellow fever, etc. These anti vaxxers...bored rabble with nothing better to do.
1	The beauty of having ample vaccines is no need to prioritize one group over another. We can vaccinate all.
0	Since there are adverse outcomes other than deaths, we need to include disability in addition to mortality.
0	anti vax for life. Everyone else should be too. Vaccines are awful. Stay pure
0	It could kill all of the people everywhere. These 2 still believe in "safe vaccines", like Kennedy. That's nonsense. All vaccines are designed as poison, no life has been saved, ever, by vaccines.
0	No fertility studies conducted. No medium or longterm safety data. Growing evidence of harm. One case of myocarditis is one case too many. It is more common in young men and boys aged 11-23 years.We must protect our young and especially our children.This is a tragedy unfolding
1	I get really emotional thinking about how much we are capable of solving huge problems if we really put our minds to it. Very grateful to all the scientists, researchers, health workers, and so many more people, who have put in such a tremendous amount of hard work into developing and distributing vaccines in record time.
0	If you're vaccinated. Don't be fooled. They start with the unvaccinated and soon it will be the unboosted. Then it will be those not boosted enough who will be discriminated against.
1	The vaccine is incredibly promising.
1	Anti-vaxxers better back off when one finally comes out
1	Already in some countries people who choose not to be vaccinated have to pay for the time they are on a ventilator in a hospital, that gets their attention
0	Anti-vaxxers or just more informed
0	Why did they require people to sign a waiver if the vaccines are safe?
0	Without Vaccination i survived, got covid-19 i give credit to my immune system and not the vaccine, not only that i seen people who are fully vaccinated and still died.
0	So much for ‘my body my choice.’
0	I know people who know people who died after taking the vax. I don’t know anyone personally that has died of Covid, but a lot that have had it.
1	Thank you to the companies, doctors, scientists, geneticists, and frontline workers that made this possible. A true achievement in human healthcare and logistics.
0	i had to laugh"overwhelming fact that the vaccine is safe"
0	I'm a white Ph.D. Aerospace Engineer and I have no plans to take the vaccine. In my mind as I am healthy and in my 50's I think at this time the potential risk outweighs the benefit.
0	Covid vaccination is a dangerous fraud
1	There are some opinions that are so absurd as to be unworthy of debate.  Arguing that the earth is flat is one example.  The safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines is another.  Your bogus fight is over.  Get the shot.
1	I would love to convince my coworkers who refuse to vaccinate but Hidden Brain has also taught me that you can’t change people’s minds with facts
1	access to safe and effective vaccines is critical to ending the COVID-19 pandemic
0	Vaccines cause your body to EAT ITSELF ALIVE!!
0	Do you get the idea that this is a money making scam from Big farma and world governments yet?
1	Vaccine will save your life and others! Get vaccinated
0	This vaccine is a fucking joke. A failure. Period.
1	My partner and I got our boosters in Scarborough at a Mosque. I got moderna because I'm 30+. My partner got Pfizer because they're 25 and under
1	The vaccine keeps you from having serious symptoms that will have you end up in the hospital.
0	Any vaccine that goes from the experimental lab, to production, to distribution in less than 10 months... Is something we should all have confidence in.... Lol
1	Anti-vaxxers have blood on their hands and, consequently, should have deaths on their consciences. An absolute disgrace.
0	It's not safe. You can get and transmit "Covid" even if you're vaccinated twice. Now go on and spread your germs. When the fifth wave comes and they ask for more doses, I hope to God y'all will wake up.
1	It’s only a matter of time that I’ll get infected with the positive samples that I’m testing. I’m a healthcare worker, a scientist as well doing the covid testing and I’m thankful I got my vaccine today.
0	But you are NOT protecting anyone. You are only putting money into the hands of big Pharma and putting yourself in harms way…
0	Shouldn't we stop the whole discussion about the use of vaccines, passes, facemasks and statistics by now? We know all this is not about health. We're distracted and wasting our time, We should rather set up an international think tank about how to create a new parallel society.
1	I feel no pity for anyone who dies when a treatment was available and they refused it
1	I’m such a nice guy. I got vaccinated so that those unvaccinated can have a hospital bed if they need one. You can thank me later.
0	I don't listen to nonsense, leather tell the world how to protect them self, instead of vaccine
1	Hope mRNA vaccines along with the other types bring back the world we knew
0	"it is pity that people are afraid to die or suffer in hospitals just like 1170 did " good job doc am i the only who think that getting the covid is a better solution ?
1	I’m fine bro. I got it
1	Nobody is forcing anyone to be vaccinated but if you want to drive a truck into the U.S or drive a truck into Canada you must be vaccinated.
0	I was never vaccinated (not even as a baby, I was born at home) and I'm 22 now and I've always been fine
1	Getting your vaccine is a very Christian think to do. You are looking out for the well-being of other people.
0	Which is why you don’t see hardly any of them speaking out against the jabs.... they probably own tons of stock in these companies... which should be illegal and shows that all these branches of gov colluded... wonder if Supreme Court justices own any of those stocks or any in dominion ... just a thought.
1	Its a very safe vaccine. There is miniscule risk of death with the vaccine. If you catch covid your chances of death are about 10, 000 times higher than if you have the vaccine. Your choice.i want the vaccine..(well I have already had it !) And there is always long covid waiting to destroy the lives of those that catch and survive the virus. Vaccines protect against that too
1	Isn't it great when ignorant people tell those who have done a ton of research that they are deluded?
1	I do not regret taking the vaccine!
1	I've had all my vaccines from when I was a baby never got sick or had the flu or anything
1	“I’m anti clothes because everyone that wears clothes dies so I’m not willing to take that risk for my kids and myself.”
0	What parents need to know is don't put that poison in your children.
1	Stick your vaccines up your arse
0	Please leave our kids alone,please don’t make it mandatory,parents should decide whether they want their kids to be vaccinated or not,but please allow them to travel etc without the requirement of the vaccine
1	If people voluntarily did the responsible thing and got vaccinated, mandates wouldn't be necessary
1	There is a reason smallpox and polio no longer ravage millions of people every year. Vaccines work.
1	As a biologist,I have to say this is a fantastic vaccine
0	When you told me that I would not spread the virus if I had the vaccine, I was confident in your research. Literally 2 months after my second shot, that all changed and I lost the confidence in your research.
1	Yes, as many people invent crazy stories about the Bill Gates and all that stuff, the companies wouldn't risk their own names making an unsafe vaccine. Also over physical health, I'm talking about mental health, I'd rather to have headache and fever for a couple of days and go to the cinema than not getting vaccinated and therefore not being able to go to school
1	She's sitting there talking about how dangerous vaccines are, denying the unnecessary deaths that have been prevented since the advent of vaccines...how much work has she had done on her face? So vaccines are a really bad idea but multiple plastic surgeries are just fine? Her face clearly demonstrates her hypocrisy. Her opinions clearly demonstrate her inability to think intellectually.
0	I wont get the shot. Our body our choices
0	Since I am a Non-Citizen and following my previous tweet, I have just registered on the National Organ Donation Refusal Registry because if our health system doesn't treat us like the Vaccinated I don't see why my organs would be used in priority for pro-vax.
1	You want to return to a normal life? Get vaccinated.
1	When people's opinions are greater then real facts...
1	No vaccine, but smoking cigarettes!flip a coin either cancer or COVID!!!
0	Why do some people report serious side effects and even organ damage? The vaccine does more damage than good
0	Medical Apartheid, alive and well in much of the world, 2022...
0	Gee...ya think??? Maybe the first 3 weren't necessary either since everyone I know who's sick is jabbed.
0	nobody said the vaccine is a cure
0	Worried about war with Russia? Scared at the prospect of possible radiation poisoning? Don't worry, Pfizer has a course of injections for that.
0	How can anyone say a drug that doesn't have any long-term test results yet is totally safe? That's the main reason I'm skeptical about it.
1	That's because most people are vaxed, no one said the vaccine stops covid, it saves a lot of people from dying and makes symptoms less
1	What needs to be done is to make the vaccine mandatory for all people living in the US.
1	What i Dont understand, whats wrong with a 2second COVID-19 Jab, yes they aren't sustainable.However, they have been effective with lowing the ommission of the spread of COVID.
1	I just got my third dose as an immunocompromised person!  At the hospital I work at, 1/3 of our patient population has Covid. Most are aged 40-50 and only 2 of the 68 Covid patients had both of their vaccinations. You’re not invincible!!! People are on 100% oxygen with saturation’s in the 80s. Delta is scary as hell.
1	I just got my 1st dose today!
0	Bill Gates being involved in these vaccines is enough for me to say HELL NO! What the hell does he have to do with medicine?
1	For everyones safety, being unvaccinated should be illegal
0	I’m taking my responsibility to be part of the solution seriously. I have a healthy lifestyle, eat a clean diet with real food, take good quality supplements especially vitamins C, D and zinc. I don’t watch the news and stay away from criminal corrupt governments and Big Pharma companies like Pfizer who received the largest criminal fine in US history ($2.3 billion). But I can’t wait to get my depopulating untested gene therapy shot of toxins, after all the U.K. government Yellow Card reporting as of May 2021 says deaths are ONLY up to 1100 and adverse reactions nearly 800,000. That is estimated between 1-10% of total reactions. Such a tiny chance of anything going wrong so line up folks roll your sleeves up your government cares about you…
0	Once I lose my common sense and decide to get a shot to avoid mild symptoms, I?ll let you know ??
0	For what it’s worth, I had the most mild case in August 2021. I ONLY lost my sense of smell. Last week I shared a smoke with a friend WITH COVID and have not been reinfected.
0	It was not safe for Lisa Shaw, of the BBC for instance. Confirmed death due to the vaccine.
1	a 90 year old vaccinated man : dies  antivax moms : IT'S THOSE DAMN VACCINES !
1	I'm allergic to penicillin. Because a small percentage of people like me could die from it, by your logic should we ban this life saving drug? I had a horrible reaction to the AZ vaccine. But I would have taken it again as COVID is much, much worse.
0	Jew Jabs. Vax backed dollars printed by jew owned Federal Reserve and vax to depopulate whites.
0	I didn't need the shot because my perfectly functional immune system sorted the issue out for me.
0	Nobody knows the long term effects and no one is held accountable if there is, I'll take my slim 99.97% chance of survival thanks.
0	Be careful! The 'vaccine' for Covid had HIV in it. Do you want to be injected with a gene therapy that has HIV?? Hard pass
1	Waking up in that hospital bed because they refused vaccines lol
1	Can't wait to take the vaccine!
1	The government needs to give an incentive to those who get vaccinated. A monthly stipend perhaps?
0	Personally, I have died 47 times from 87 different variants and I still wouldn't want to be stabbed.
0	ALL CORONAVIRUS VACCINE ARE BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS AND AGENTS MAKE SURE EVERYONE KNOWS THIS
1	It is good to vaccinated in urban area were over crowd of people, but how can COVID_19 can spread in remote area..,it is an individual option to choose
0	Don't call a conspiracy theorist but I'm gonna stick to nature's course and not inject chemicals inside my body.
0	People have so much faith in vaccines, they can’t even admit that all the others are just as much of a scam. Vaccine-faith people refuse to even research all the other ones, but they’ll definitely research this one. Why only this one?
1	I'd say 90% of the people that I know that have been vaccinated were barely affected. I had a sore arm for 24 hours after the first one. That was it.
0	I’m not vaccinated against covid, I am against everything else. But I did recover from it. And with all the new studies coming out, I believe recovering is proving to be more effective protection than the vaccine but time will tell if that is true or not I suppose. Either way, I think recovery should count as vaccinated. In the meanwhile hopefully I don’t lose my job.
1	I am proud to be a fully #vaccinated doggo. #VaccinesWork #VaccinesSaveLives
1	Getting the vaccine to protect yourself from hospitalization will keep the hospitals ready for your grandparents should they need it
0	Several people I know who have been vaccinated still ended up getting the virus in the months following 2nd shot and boosters. Not only that, they also had severe discomfort caused by the vaccine itself in the days following inoculation.
1	A year ago, I got the #CovidVaccine when I was #pregnant, as did many frontline colleagues. To all who are pregnant & unvaccinated, we got vaxxed to protect our pregnancies, AND so you could have the data & peace of mind we didn’t have. No regrets. MFM, Houston #GetVaccinated
0	Never get that shot you’ll turn into a zombie in 5 years…
0	Some side effects from vaccination include chills, fever, sore arms and muscle aches for a brief period of time.
1	Awesome. Bring it on. Offer to everyone for free, and whoever chooses to go unprotected & loses their life as a result, so be it. The End...
0	if the flu vaccine doesnt work bcz the flu mutates so much, why should the covid one work when covid mutates just as much lol
1	What's concerning to me is long term sustainability.
0	I've been ill for 8 months following my second Pfizer I'm suffering long vaccine.
1	When will this Novavax be available in the US? I have vascular issues so the mRNA jabs haven't gone well for me and I'd like to hold out for protein based jab that wasn't rushed like the mRNAs were...
0	I don’t want to be genetically modified. I’m not a food. I’m also not a lab rat waiting to be injected with some experimental fluid. I think I’d rather test positive for Covid then get anywhere near this vaccine. Sorry:(
1	The comments on this thread is unbelievable.Get yr jabs, we all had it including my teens & we r all well. Most hospitalised r unvaccinated that's a fact
0	when he says that it only works if everybody gets it, he is literally admitting it doesn't work.
1	Real truckers would know not to take Terminal, but of course real truckers also got the vaccine.
0	"There is absolutly no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic. I've never heard such nonsense talked about vaccines. You do not vaccine people who aren't at risk from disease. You also don't set about planning to vaccinate millions of fit and healthy people with a vaccine that hasn't been extensively tested on human subjects" -Dr. Mike Yeadon former VIP of Pfizer
1	As a medical professional it kills me to hear people with zero education, experience or understanding preach to others about the “dangers” of vaccines! If you don’t have knowledge or experience changing a transmission, are you going to change it yourself or possibly take your vehicle to a professional to ensure the job is done properly? The same principle applies to medical advice!
1	That's true, but then the patient is also responsible for the consequences: dying, getting much more sick, losing your job, etc. Mandatory vaccinations is not a new thing
1	I will take my second injection today
0	You must be vaccinated, the Mercury has blocked your brain cells.
1	So great news
1	My dad is anti-vaxx and I’m using your video as one of my sources as why he’s absolutely insane.
1	If they were smart they'd go get vaccinated and be grateful they live in a 1st world country with access.
0	then u realize vaccines aren’t safe
0	Never VAXXED, never will be. This makes me sick.
0	Booster shots ! So the ppl Will Need to keep putting their life at risk? 😡😡 yall Must be out of your mind !
0	My youngest son became autistic after having the MMR vaccine.  They are full of it
1	I want the vaccine so I can go to school without risking the "virus" that caused the lockdown
0	the vaccine is as  as "safe and effective" as their President is competent and legitimate
1	Vaccines do work. They prevent serious disease, not infection itself.
0	No way am I taking it. One of the mild side effects are hair loss! Wtf are the serious side effects!?
0	I had COVID-19 last month. The side effects for the vaccine sound like they are worse than what I had with the actual virus.
0	Taking the vaccine in exchange for the hope on an easier progression of the illness, is like cutting off your leg to avoid athletes foot!
0	I'm no one's lab rat..
1	We need lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines in every community across the country. That means we need comprehensive aid to all states, cities and counties to administer the vaccine quickly and efficiently.
0	Vaccine inserts say it might end in death - go to fda vaccine insert site and read it.
0	China's #Sinopharm #CovidVaccine Most unsafe in the world, with 73 Side effects: Chinese Vaccine expert. Still many countries are using these vaccines from #CCP. How can anyone buy #CCPVaccine?
1	We have a strict policy no unvaccinated relatives and their spawn cross our threshold.
0	...and you want me vaccinated ? To hell with your vaccines
1	I feel bad for a lot of these people that think the vaccine is a hoax. If they had only taken 1 college level biology course they would completely understand how it works and why it was able to be produced so fast.
1	Protect yourself: Get vaccinated
0	Soooooo, I’ll stay with naturally immune. If I’ve survived this epidemic so far I’ll continue my 99.98% chances
1	got my first dose today pfizer
0	I risked to remain semi paralyzed after the first shot of Pfizer.
1	I am a Registered Nurse. I feel privileged to have received 3 doses of the covid vaccine. My colleagues & I are committed to caring for ALL patients w/compassion & dignity, irrespective of vaccination status. We will not be intimidated.
0	You morons. Omikron is not an issue regatding hospitalizations. Mandates ate nonsense and dangerous intervention in basic human rights regarding the own body. The individual decision to reject a forced medical treatment without any personal or sociatal benefit for anybody, has to be protected by any means.
1	don't understand why people won't get vaccinated.
1	These people have too much time on their hands. These people seem like they aren’t even educated in health or science. Just basing their judgement on emotions or what they believe, not what’s been proven.
1	COVID IS A POLITICAL HOAX
1	I have my three doses and I can honestly say that it has helped prevent me from getting sick. I used to get sick often but after getting vaccinated I’ve gone from getting sick four times a year to only once.
1	I don’t understand why they don’t trust the doctor when they tell people to get vaccinated, but they trust the exact same doctor to treat them for the illness they could have been vaccinated against.
1	My Mother and I received our 2nd dose of Pfizer just yesterday.
1	So, are you saying the unvaccinated people dying in the streets of india of delta were faking it?
0	The vaccine should still be by choice! Government taking your freedom away! Don't be blind! You can still get covid after your fully vaccinated.. How I know, it happened to my sister and she got very sick. But getting better.
1	Awesome! Put this one in the water so the anti vaxxers don't get a choice.
0	I find it hard to believe that Covid19 is evolving as rapidly as it is, without having some kind of manipulations. It seems like the moment we are almost done with the pandemic, another variant shows up.
1	Sorry… not sorry! Sick of people being so selfish! They infect people they can’t get vaccinated… kids!!!
1	Well, it’s not like any of us expect anti-vaxx people to be smart
0	Dont get the vaccine DONT BE THE SHEEP
0	Is this even safe? what if this vaccine is worse than the virus that has 99% survival rate.
1	You are welcome to say you don't trust anything about covid numbers. But you have no actual position on how effective vaccines are, whereas all the numbers show that it greatly reduces mortality rates
1	It's not a legitimate point of view, it's morons spreading harmful lies.
1	To all people who are denying the vaccine: People like you are making the virus stay, killing more people, all because your hole covered brain doesn’t like vaccines. Please just take the vaccine or we will be doomed
1	Too bad they would not put the same effort into getting vaccinated. We have something to help with covid and people are still complaining. The vaccine lessens the severity of covid and lockdowns and masks prevents death death an prevents ICU from being over run with covid.
0	Stop telling people what they must do with their bodies. You take it.
1	Do you honestly believe that the majority of health professionals around the world would knowingly come out in support of vaccinations because they're scared not to? There's not some big conspiracy trying to withold the "truth". Vaccines are safe.
0	I didn't realize that so many were still unvaccinated.  Well done fellow gents!
0	I don't need protection from Omicron. I need protection from Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson.
1	Under 10% of new cases are fully vaccinated.
1	I am vaccinated today and my arm sore 24 hour I am very excited to see the end of Corona 😭😂😂😂😭☺️
1	When a person has spent months and months making fun of people who take precautions and spreading lies which are likely causing deaths, they don't deserve a ton of respect just for dying.  Dying doesn't change the fact that their behavior in life was likely appalling.
1	vaccines are made to reduce the amount being hospitalized.. how can they not understand this?
1	What doesn’t kill you mutates and tries again
1	Take the vaccines. … It is working
0	Is this North Korea and I don't know it? They will never force this thing to me.
1	Pricks scared of a needle.
0	Taking the vaccine in exchange for the hope on an easier progression of the illness, is like cutting off your leg to avoid athletes foot!
0	I find the people most angry about those that haven't taken the shots, are those that feel remorse for taking said shots, they want us to join in the fun of any potential long-term side effects.
1	They should have darted them with vaccine from drones and helicopters.
0	my daughter spent the night in the ER last Monday. I have photos of her clots which were 3-4 inches long. This was her first cycle following her first dose of Pfizer. She's never had problems before. The one nurse who looked at the photos (which hospital staff asked her to take so they could see what she was complaining about) said that her sister had the same type of clots following the vax. However, staff would not list these huge, abnormal clots as a side effect of the vax.  The clots came every 20-30 minutes. Very scary & unusual. Needless to say, she will not be getting the 2nd dose
1	Anti vaxxers are very simple people who love to spend time with others who are also hard of thinking
0	Omicron is God's vaccine and he is listening to us. He knows and this is why the elite are getting exhausted and this is why they are admitting things they lied about. God knows they are trying to mess with his children and they are gonna get the wrath of their creator before this new year is over
1	Thank you Dr, I'm still regretting not taking our booster shot before we went on vacation... husband, I, and my 7 yr old all got covid, ..thank God our 10 month old didn't show signs...but because we are vaccinated it didn't stay for long. And we didn't have severe symptoms. Just me because it became a cold/sinus infection . I wish I have gotten my booster in the first place because my Pfizer shot was from June. Anyway...lesson learned we are just nervous about our kids getting this especially my 10 month. Finding good kn95 masks for kids is so hard. I'm hoping her shot will be enough for her in school these last couple months.
0	The vaccine should be tested on politicians first. If they survive, the vaccine is safe.
1	To be anti vaccine is akin to being anti life.
1	I thank countries that are making it possible for everyone to get vaccinated. Together we shall win the battle against covid19.
0	I took the vaccine yesterday and I got the worst migraine of my life today. The night followig the vaccination I felt chills the whole night and was freezing even with two thick hoodies on. I regret taking it so fkn much as I was completely fine before and I never got sick with covid these last 2 years
1	Fine, no one's saying survivors don't have some natural immunity. But if you want to avoid infection (with all possible morbidities), or have a relatively mild case, get vaccinated.
0	Vaccine does not do what government said it would do so that’s why people don’t want it.
1	I have taken mine too and I can say it's fully safe and their is no magnetic field anywhere
1	I believe in our Doctors Scientist they Find Vaccines And Save Us From Corona But Now We Have To Be safe In Our Home First. And Also This is nice To raise Funds For WHO  😊
1	Look! How to stop covid =19 ? Ans = Only way to stop covid is to take Vaccine, One of the most inportant ingreadingents in a Vaccine is thr antigen. So. Give vaccine save yourself & family.
0	Your government hates you and will kill you to protect its vaccine empire. It will kill you to maintain control. Hate it back.
1	If COVID-19 is anywhere, it is potentially everywhere. COVID-19 vaccines will save many lives.
0	Do I need a vaccine? NO, why do we put millions on a virus that has 99% mortality rate when there are millions dying of starvation? And why do we forget the environment? If we cant prioritise the right things dont expect me to accept your syringes with heavy metals in them! My former classmate got his life ruined from the swineflue vaccine and the people who recommended Sweden to take it, they didnt do it themselves!!
1	Join our fight for vaccine justice and to end this pandemic!
1	I'm in Tier 1C, when it's my turn, I'll take whatever is available, although I'm not too crazy about AstraZeneca.
1	"I need a vaccine to protect me, but if you don't get one too, mine won't work"
1	No jab? No job. Pretty simple, especially if there is an order to do so.
1	No vaccine works 100%. That's why everyone needs to get it. If it worked 100% then we could stop giving it like we did for smallpox once that worked to eradicate the disease. And even that vaccine didn't work 100%. You still got the disease and you were still infectious.
0	Covid is treatable and the vaccine is riskier than it is protective for most. The narrative is crumbling.
0	I had covid last April... My body took care of it... Naturally vaccinated
1	Just get the vaccine and stop complaining like a baby.
0	The pandemic was never about health ...but allways about control..
1	I got my second dose on the 7th of this month.  My work place asked about vaccinations on sight, and some people are scared about it.  But low and behold the  CDC passed the no mask for fully vaccinated people and next week I am able to go mask free at work.  Overall I didn't get the vaccine because of not wearing a  mask, didn't do it because  of family because they got vaccinated.  I did it for me, yes I am more scared of the long term side effects of covid then the vaccine.
0	The definition of insanity, doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.
0	Where do you get the "90 to 94%" efficiency rates?  No vaccine ever has such a high rate of protection.  As these vaccines are in the experimental phases we can't make such assessments.  Heavily vaccinated countries show high rates of infection.  The only observable effects of the vaccines is a dampened down hospitalisation rate.  I think these figures have been manipulated by various agencies who benefit financially from the sale of these vaccines.
1	This if confirmed would be a monumental feat. One actual vaccine that prevents all colds common or novel. After seeing the severe fatigue coronavirus can cause first hand it is understandable the military would do everything in its power to create a solution quickly. Readiness must be maintained.
1	Freedom comes with responsibilities. Anti-vaxxers are irresponsible so why should they get freedom?
0	I leave my vaccine to somebody that really needs it.
1	If you don't vaccinate your kids, you should be treated differently. The benefit of the collective is more important than the wants of a single person.
1	It uttely astonishes me that there are groups of people in this day and age who don't believe in vaccines! Had a very heated discussion with an anti-vacciner who simply was bent on proving to me that he was immune to covid-19
0	Drug trials, we've been informed, take ten years (to insure their safety). Yet, in just a few months, an arsenal of vaccines will be available for use. Even the most rudimentary minds can sense that something isn't quite right... There's no choice but to raise red flags and suspicions...!
1	It was about time! Don’t forget this is the most tested vaccine in medicine. Approx. 3 billion doses !
0	Many were pro-vax until their child died or was injured.
1	I would never trust today tests, a cold triggers a positive
0	Probably because they are young and, having followed the science, are aware that the vaccines do little to prevent transmission. If the risk posed to someone by a virus is minimal and the vaccines don't reduce the risk of transmission to others, on what basis should they be getting vaccinated?
0	I had a stroke at 40, I’m 44 now and there’s no way I’m getting vaccinated. I don’t need anymore health problems. The government has gone too far with the mandates.
0	Thank you for covering this. I found it  amazing how similar the adverse vaccine affects she described are to Lyme disease symptoms.
1	I remember being amazed when the COVID-19 vaccine was made so quickly, and after watching this, I am even more amazed by how revolutionary this new way of making vaccines is. An applause to everybody who contributed in making and giving out these wonderful stuff. And thank you for the good video.
0	I have taken every vaccines of various dieseases as prescribed age wise since childhood. But looking at numerous unreported side effects after vaccination in India, I am feeling tensed and skeptical about this one.
1	I was vaccine hesitant for awhile since I had covid 2 times and only got moderate symptoms but now with the rise of the delta and other variants I decided to get vaccinated and so far I am very happy with my choice and my ability to look past all this fake news crap about the vaccine!! Now I just gotta convince my dad! Wish me luck
0	Why are you not talking about the liquid metal in those poison that you satanist assholes promote? The vials are NOT contaminated, THERE IS LIQUID METALS IN THE VACCINES!
1	The anti-vaxers and anti-masker have their own distorted view. Perhaps we should leave it like that and let natural selection take its course and see who is right.
1	Boosters prevent serious COVID-19 illness. Get vaccinated + boosted
0	One thing that the jab stops is a long and healthy life.
1	It is not okey to not take the vaccine
0	How can fully vaccinated healthcare workers be monitored for breakthrough cases when they only mandate unvaccinated to test biweekly?
0	The vaccine gets too much credit for giving less symptoms. It's almost as if they need to justify the vaccine some how.
0	I just want to say to EVERYONE pushing the Jab. Good luck at Nuremberg 2.0
0	Benefits out weight the risks! Tell that to the 28 year old who had a heart attack
0	I won’t get it til there’s been long term extensive research and testing done. I want babies very badly so better safe than sorry imo.
1	I believe that there should be a law  that you need to vaccinate your child no matter what. If not prison
0	Why don’t you talk about the vaccine’s side effects which includes infertility in women, nerve damage and Anaphylactic shock for people who have severe allergies
0	I can't believe people are ok with mandatory vaccination.
0	Or ask someone who had it like a girl in my school who said it’s not even as bad as a cold
1	Good! The more people vaccinated, the better.And mandate the military all getting vaccinated. It’s a national security issue.
1	These anti-vaxxers are the same as mentally insane murderers - they are responsible for the deaths of others due to their strange beliefs. Murderers are usually victims of abuse. Should we feel bad when they die?
1	I had COVID. It is not the flu. The vaccines protected me or I would have ended up in hospital.
1	The more that gets vaccinated the better off we will be.
1	Good news. We need more vaccines for our country's population and also for those less fortunate than ourselves living in poorer nations.
1	Very thorough, very well informed. Great video Doctor, thank you for this!
1	The vaccine does not prevent transmission of the virus directly, but reduces the severity of symptoms and severe illness due to covid, which prevents our hospital system from being swamped with cases and prevents people dying.
1	Mask & vaccine really works anyway
1	In order to finish with the vaccine hesitancy, for one and for all, I suggest you to do the following video. Please acquire a box of each vaccine, open it in front of the camera, take out the vaccine package insert and read it out loudly in front of everyone.
0	Love how he just describes an invisible ink injection like it's an everyday thing...think I'll risk the supposed deadly virus instead.
1	I don't understand how they are so angry and against vaccines, but believe in all other things they use that are created by the same science and research.
0	Ok yeah if it actually worked tho what about all the vaccinated people still dying from Covid?
1	It’s never too late to get vaccinated. The NHS is always ready for you to come forward and get your first, second or booster jab.
0	i work out 5 times a week i drink no sodas i don’t smoke i eat extremely healthy take vitamins and all that. but i will not get the vaccine so i not take care of my self. i don’t get flu shot either i don’t wear a mask and i have no been sick and i live in the south
1	The scientific basis for anti-Covid measures is solid:Vaccines have been proven to reduce transmission, substantially slash the likelihood of serious illness and decrease the burden on healthcare systems
0	Considering that doctors are basically paid to sell drugs by the pharmaceutical companies, it’s very easy to still be skeptic even with what you’re sayin. Yes, some conspiracies sound outlandish and ridiculous, but the fact they damn near forcing people to get it. Paying people to get it. It’s very sketchy to me.
0	Comirnaty Pfizer Vaccine is a HOAX approved by FDA without even seeing it as no one have ever seen its one vial. It's never manufactured and never distributed. I called Pfizer headquarters in New York, they don't have it either so till I will not see it personally, I call it Hoax
1	Get the dam shot!
1	the vaccines were as effective as promised but variants happened
0	If you get the vaccine you CAN still get covd and STILL transmit covid. HOW is someone getting the vaccine keeping OTHERS safe???
1	I am fully vaccinated. I also wear a seatbelt and don’t drive the wrong way on the highway. I don’t drink bleach or play Russian roulette. I do these things not because “the government is controlling me” but because I want to live and spend time with my family and friends.
1	I got my first shot yesterday and this video was very interesting. My dad spoke to me and told me that it could also possibly end like a virus in Singapore. When he was in 6th grade, everyone had to get a vaccine. Slowly, when everyone had, the virus died out! Also, thank you for your videos, they’re very interesting and helpful. You got me into science and explain things in simple ways for people who are just starting as well! :)
0	dont get it it has a chance of killing you please trust me
1	Got my first covid vaccine last week... Best thing I ever did
0	Emergency use of vacine for actual babies??? There is something wrong with these people!
0	SHOCK: Thousands on Twitter Say They ‘Regret’ Getting the Vaccine — ‘Side-Effects Worse than COVID’
0	STOP TREATING PEOPLE LIKE LAB RATS! THESE PHARMA COMPANIES ARE SO DISGUSTING AND SO GREEDY
0	I’m still not getting vaccinated.
0	Guinea pig's these day's…
0	If the risk of adverse reactions to the COVID vaccines is so low, why do the pharma companies need legal immunity?
1	I've got you shots I feel fine. There are no Guarantees in life. I'm sorry and pray for all those who died from COVID.
1	The basis for every action is trust in science.
0	I truly do not understand why government's think covid vax is a silver bullet. I guess it's what happens when you have no tools in the tool box
1	The good news is that those fully vaccinated with the booster are doing very well at this point. For example in the last 120 days in Alberta there have been only 5 deaths among the people 3 doses for those under 60, 105 among the unvaccinated. It's more of a problem for those over 60 but even there it's less among the people with 3 doses, 85 deaths among the vaccinated and boosted compared to 351 among the vaccinated.
1	In 2 weeks, i'll be receiving the second jab of this Pfizer vaccine. I just love these people for being able to develop this masterpiece. THANK YOU!
0	After the many years of walking around in this human body, I have come to realize that no one will ever force a good thing on you.
0	The reason why they made covid-19 spread is because they want to try this mnar human trials
0	Because with the disease you know better at the moment what to expect, with the vaccination not yet.
0	chances of dying from lightning are also way higher then chances of dying from covid statistically speaking lol.
0	If evidence emerges of long-term negative health consequences, don’t be surprised if it’s ignored and suppressed. Like the link between the exponential increase in childhood vaccinations and the concomitant rise in autism.
0	Robert Kennedy Jr explains why Pfizer wants to vaccinate children, and it's horrible…
0	Vaccine = myth
1	It's difficult to have any empathy for those in the public eye, with a platform and who, for any reason are passing along DANGEROUS misinformation to the public about the pandemic, and themselves become a victim of their own misinformation. Worse yet are when those same people end up in the ICU and their family and friends start asking the public to keep that person in their thoughts and prayers. What about all the unknown people who listened to their dangerous misinformation and died because of it?
1	Some good news regarding long term duration of vaccines preventing the worst outcomes of covid.
0	Keep your Fauci sauce
0	This is insane! The NIH has an article claiming over boosting is reducing antibodies. 1/3 of my coworkers have been pos in last 3 weeks. All vaxxed and boosted. None of the unvaxxed coworkers have gotten in at all.
0	Note to Self Stop taking Jabs!!
1	Props to that guy who said he thinks of the vaccine like a civic duty.
0	Genetically Modified Black-Eyed Baby 2.0.... mRNA Vaccine ADN Listen to what he/she says... !!!
1	Got my booster dose for #COVID19. #CovidVaccine is safe, effective and saves lives. I urge all eligible persons to get vaccinated as we continue our battle against the pandemic. #TogetherWeCan
1	I had seizures for years due to the DPT shot as a kid. So I was hesitant when my daughter was born thankfully we have a great family doctor who acknowledged that the old DPT vaccines were not great but then explained to me how they changed since I was a kid. Also he was willing to work with me so my daughter only got one vaccine at a time (not multiple like most vaccine schedules) this made me much more comfortable so I didn’t feel like her body was getting overwhelmed and gave me insurance that if there was a reaction I would know to what and we would not do the boosters to it. Thankfully she has had no reaction to any of them. I could have easily been turned into an anti vaxer if I would have not had a great doctor to sit talk with me and work it out so I was comfortable with the process.....Great Doctors Save Lives.
1	I’m not against getting the vaccine , I feel you have the right to choose ! What I am against is the government mandating it and forcing it on everyone
0	Its The vaccine which is causing everyone to get sick. Mark my words !!!
0	“My body, my choice” spread the word. Use their own language against them.
1	of course you can catch it and spread it, no one ever said you couldn't. It's not a shield! Understand how a vaccine works; it gives your immune system (Tcells) the blueprints to the virus so it can fight it off right away. It's not perfect, no vaccine is, no pharmaceutical is, but it does greatly reduce the risk of transmission and the risk of being hospitalized or even dying. Those are facts, not opinion!
1	The ingredients in vaccines are safe in the amounts used.
1	shots aren't even that bad, yeah it hurts, but only for a second.
1	It got all of us (4) over Thanksgiving and the 1st week of December. Very glad we were all vaxxed; we felt gross but it was manageable. Thanks for the message and sharing with humor.
0	Stop Killing people with Vaxxcines, The more Vaccinated the Higher the Death Rate. The Vaccines are a COMPLETE FAILURE.
0	I had Covid in beginning. 5 days only. Then i got delta variant 2 months ago. Was sick for 2 weeks... I never sweated so much in my life until my amazing immune system fought like hell to combat a synthetic modified man made virus.. I drink, smoke, and I am overweight. I also don't live on pharmaceutical meds. I recovered...
0	The only thing that parents need to know is that don’t inject this poison to your poor kid
0	NO ONE can say what actual long term affects will happen, because the shots are still 'experimental'. It will take up to 5 years before a true study can be performed and long term effects can be assessed. BY the way, have you seen any paperwork that should come with the vaccine that states ALL RISK factors and adverse reactions? NOPE YOU HAVE NOT and no one has! WAKE UP. Get the shot if you feel comfortable with it and are knowing acknowledging the possible risks, but do not tell other to get it or not and never claim it is safe when even the scientist won't say that without using words like maybe, could be, possibly, 'no evidence' that being a KEY word right now as Pregnant and young people have only been getting this shot for less than a year. NO ONE KNOWS THE OUTCOME YET.
0	Covid risk 0, vaccine risk 100%. All MD's are quacks.
0	One thing to not forget, once the vaccine is in, there is no way out.
1	My Dad had polio, as the vaccine was being created. Vaccinations saved SO MANY lives!!
0	Just like fire all unvaccinated health care workers because the vaccinated healthcare workers are better protected for the most vulnerable but yet vaccinated workers with breakthrough Covid can now return to work after 5 days but the unvaccinated are still more harmful???
1	Most people who are up to date on COVID-19 vaccination with no COVID-like symptoms do not need to quarantine or be restricted from work or school following an exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
0	I tested positive and took ivermectin for three days. Knowing it’s effectiveness, I now understand why big pharm is pushing so hard against it. I will never endanger my family nor myself with these experimental injections masked as vaccines.
0	What if the vaccine shows its side effects after 5-6 years? A vaccine needs decades to be considered safe, and we can't even sue the vaccine company. And now it's getting mandatory, I'm so out of clue
1	Coming from someone who got both doses of vaccine, it SHOULD be a choice. I respect anybody who chooses not to get vaccinated because nobody knows what they're going through or what kind of condition or what beliefs they have that influence their decision. Just because the CDC thinks & says its the "right thing to do" doesn't mean it is for one particular person.
0	If you get the shot for others...make sure it is not experimental and they back it if you become compromised... I did in 1976
0	This is still listed as an “ experimental drug”. Meaning you can’t be forced to take it under any circumstance . Period!!! Keep fighting people
0	Nobody cares about your vaccine filled with heavy metals and carcinogens Don’t take the vax Don’t wear the mask
1	There are more vaccinated people alive than unvaccinated. Get the damn shot
1	Only uneducated people are not vaccinated
1	The covid sohtis no different from a flu shot
0	I will never, ever understand why people actually think the government EVER has your best interests at heart.
1	For the people who are unvaccinated and saying it’s some big conspiracy theory, I would love to see reputable sources or just sources in general saying that exact same thing. Because you’re just blowing hot air at this point
1	Thats brilliant . lets pray nobody suffers with any of the side effects Times are though and to stay positive is a great challenge but lets all try . Lots of ppl are syill loosing their lives so the only hope is the vaccine
0	Please take a moment to remember the 17 y.o. golfer Viggo Sorensen who "suddenly" passed away from the "very rare" heart condition
0	I'm not trying to get pregnant, but I can say that my cycle has been completely messed up since getting the vaccine. I'm constantly on my period. I have been diagnosed with PCOS BEFORE getting the vaccine so I do think that is why my body has responded this way but i do think if I decided to try for a baby my fertility would be affected.
1	Get vaccinated. Wear a mask. Actually give a shit about those around you.  It's not that difficult.  If this offends you in anyway, you're part of the problem.
0	Take the vaccine at your own risk! I am not gonna take that shot! You can not force me!
1	I am proud to say that I'm getting my second vaccine
1	I had covid 19 and beat it......and still got the shot just in case. I don't wish this for anyone. Until you have it and realize what it does to you, You really appreciate the little things in life.
1	All anarchists should be pro vax. We're not 12 year olds who do the opposite of what our parents say just because. Vaccinations are safe and administered in the majority they protect the weakest, which is a clear case of solidarity. We do it not because it is mandated or encouraged by the government but because we help our fellow humans
1	This doctor gives me hope. I had the first Moderna shot, and am so scared to get the second, because of what I hear. After watching people with Covid-19 online......the shot is worth it.
1	Hopfully the stock market will be at ATH on 2 weeks if the vaccine works well
0	Still no to vaccine
0	At his confirmation hearing today, Desantis’ Surgeon General nominee Joseph Ladapo is asked a simple question: Are the covid vaccines safe and effective? He refuses to answer the question.
1	I literally cried when my parents got their shots. I’d spent the entire pandemic worried about them and knowing they had another layer of protection that’s at a 90% plus level made covid seem a lot less scary.
0	Every individual is the master of their own body.
1	Send the anti-vaxxers home NOW. My fucking god. Nobody should have to die because of these trash people.
0	I’m thinking it may reduce cognitive function, because they keep going back for more boosters of the same stuff that didn’t previously work
1	I had the Pfizer biotech jab, wonderful protection with no side effects.
0	The vaccines were created so quickly because they don't work. All my family who have been vaccinated have come down with the bug. I wasn't and I haven't.
0	I would rather get omicron twice than Thrombosis from vector vaccine
0	I just wanted normal life back and I, stupidly, overlooked potential issues. Last spring when they became readily available the narrative was take this and have your life back. Thats a powerful message and I fell for it. Now I see that it was all complete bullshit and they have been lying to us more than I knew. Won't be taking a single booster or listening to anything they say from now on.
1	Those of us living through COVID will see more people dying year after year and more people being disabled by Long COVID year after year. Hopefully, when we die COVID and Long COVID dies with us. I pray future generations will develop immunity to COVID.
1	Vaccines exixts for protect you and the others
0	I'm having a hard time believing that the vaccine is helpful.  I'm an average civilian with only a foundation in holistic living.  The doctors on those circles have different takeson this vaccine. Everyone has seemed to agree that it doesn't prevent spread. When people arecurrently still contracting this at varying degrees, it seems like the vaccine is really not doing anything. I'm happy to follow guidelines and will still get my booster when available, but i feel like it's just arbitrary.  Also, we've found (at least from some things I've read) that antibacterial materials, etc (please excuse my ignorance) can lead to germs mutating. Where is the evidence that the vaccine didn't cause the virus to mutate, so that it stays alive. Not trying to be anti vax, but i want to understand better. To the naked eye out all seems like science just wants to appear like it's doing "something".  Thank you.
0	Why the hell are you taking these vaccines without knowing what’s in them? And then listen to these people with their lying explanation not even mentioning the heart attacks that people are getting shakes that never go away? Are you just trying to die
0	My Protection is God not some vaccine
1	I realize that every stupid people who downplayed the severity of that virus or refuse to wear the masks or to take the vaccine, died from COVID .
1	Bless his heart. I get the flu shot every single year despite the rare risk of guillan barre because the benefits outweigh the small risk.
1	I feel bad for the students who complied and risked their health, there now wasn’t any reason to do so
1	The anti-vaxxers can have bodily autonomy on the moon where there is no atmosphere to carry their disease to the sovereign state of me
1	He's not anti vaccine, he's just not sure of the long term effects of the vaccine. It takes years to determine that.
0	I caught Covid very early on. It was like a bad cold that lasted 2 weeks. Ever since then I have been out and about and haven’t been sick since then. There are studies out there that prove natural immunity is long lasting and stronger than vaccine protection
0	A lot of people just don't like having things shoved down their throats without their consent.
1	Hard to imagine that so few of the health workers in the Ozarks are vaccinated - just imagine going into hospital for a heart attack and catching Covid from your nurse and dying
0	I would not vaccinate my teens. It’s killing people and a lot of Adverse reactions
0	Does anyone else see this as disturbing that they are pushing vaccines so hard on people who don't want it?!?!
0	I had my first short of Pfizer two weeks ago and had really bad side effects chills, excessive sweating , tingle on my lips and left side of my body , brain zaps and elevated Bp … ended up in emergency twice …all my blood test and CT scans are clear going for an MRI I googled and found that there are a lot of people having similar symptoms but feel like doctors are scared to link these symptoms with Pfizer vaccination
0	I don’t wanna get the 3rd vaccine…if you have the vaccine, you have COVID-19
0	Much respect for these protesting folks! Stay safe
1	I love how they're still debating the doctors to death
0	I got the vaccine after I heard of the Delta variant and how bad it was. That was my choice. But I support all the people who don't want it. And it really makes me mad they are trying to force something like this on people.
1	COVID vaxes are the only way to fight this battle.
0	As we have seen, some people live in alternate realities where the vaccine stops transmission or illness #sad #mentalhealth
1	My hubby and I had our first dose of Pfizer today. Nothing felt so far except for pain on vaccinated site for the first 15-20 mins and occassional muscle pain in the first 30 mins. After that, nothing felt again. Still feeling good :)
1	I stayed at home for a few days with it. Totally worth three virtually painless shots.
0	This is horrendous. Get your jab to help someone else live a life! How about personal responsibility for protecting your own life and making the right health choices! Never heard anything so selfish to coerce people to have a vaccine for others! People have a vaccine to protect themselves end of. If a person doesn't need that vaccine they don't get it if they don't want it
0	My fathers oncologist asked him if he had gotten the vaccine or the booster to which my father said no, oncologist replied good.
0	Could this mean: 1. with the COVID vaccines, the government has put forward the first seeds for mandatory health treatments 2. More pharmaceuticals will be forced on people. Flu vaccines will be the first to become mandatory 3. They will have a docile population, over-medicated that will depend completely on the health system
1	1st dose felt nothing 2nd dose sick and unwell for 1 week.  Lets just hope COVID 19 oendemic ends soon
0	"We don't know if the vaccines are safe until we use them ..." FDA scientist approving vaccines for children.
1	Can we take a moment to appreciate the work ethic and efficiency of all those in AstraZeneca that have been producing the vaccines almost at cost prices?
1	In other words, wear your fcking mask and get vaccinated
1	I think we are going to need to make a hard choice with respect to hospitals. We need to change the priority of patients. Other people are dying, suffering and/or not seeking treatment because these folks refuse to take a vaccine for political reasons. This of course would need to exclude children or those with medical exemptions.
0	I give my dose to the World Health Organization
1	I like making fun of anti vaxxxers
0	Every single downfall he mentioned about natural immunity can also be said about the vaccine. I wonder why people don't realize how they contradict themselves pushing for vaccinations?
1	I got all three of my shots as soon as I could & helped several family members get theirs, not only to protect our health & livelihoods, but the wider community & the healthcare system, and because it's the only chance we have of returning to normalcy.
1	I'll hustle hard with no job before I take a vaccine. Faith not Fear
1	I love pfizer
1	When antivaccinators get vaccinated. They are huge spreaders
1	Neil Young is passionate about vaccines and vaccine misinformation because he survived polio as a child and am sure many people he knew didnt
1	The federal government is providing the COVID-19 vaccine free of charge to all people living in the United States, regardless of their immigration or health insurance status.
1	Got mine last week. I know it's not going to protect me 100%, but a little is better than nothing, IMO.
1	If I need a 3rd dose, I will be first in line! People need to quit whining and making this political because you are literally killing yourselves. Getting a vaccine doesn't have to be a big deal!
1	Actually the opposite. Vaccine is safe but even mild cases of COVID can leave people with Long Covid which can be debilitating for many .
1	My pregnant wife and I got our Moderna boosters and we are perfectly good. Following Dr Faucis recommendations we avoided Covid until now. I had high fewer after my booster shot so that I know it stimulated my immune system and in the case of real infection my body will react immediately. We are a fully vaccinated happy American family.
0	Last year Fauci promised us that vaccinated people would be "dead ends" for covid and the CEO of Pfizer said the vaccine was "100% effective." Today Israel has the highest case rate in the world after rolling out a fourth shot. At what point can we admit that we were lied to?
0	Real vaccines give you immunity, just sayin'.
1	I felt rough for a few days after the vaccine, but I'd take it all day long before having Covid. My friend who fell ill with Covid before he could get the vaccine is going through hell. In his words he's existing in between coughing.
1	I've had the first of the Johnson &Johnson vaccines, I'm in the Ensemble 2 trial where they are doing two doses instead of one, two months apart. I had the first one a couple of weeks ago, and had a very strong reaction to it, it wasn't pleasant at all, and evidently wasn't the placebo! I missed work the following day , and it wasn't until 6 days later that my arm stopped hurting. But it was worth it.
0	REMEMBER IF YOUR KID HAS AN ALLERGIC REACTION OR DIES YOU CANT SUE
1	YESSSS, VACCINES FOR THE WIN!!!
0	The vaccine does not stop u from getting it nor does it stop u spreading it. Facts! So that dr guy is saying a lot of false information
0	Interesting how you know there will be future stains. Oh yeah, there is a reason why some call it the plan-demic. Good luck with your forever multiple jabs, mama may have raised a dummy but certainly not a fool.
0	IM A NURSE THE FACT IS THEY NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAD MASS VACCINATION IN A PANDEMIC. THIS AND THIS ALONE CREATES THE DIFFERENT STRAINS OF COVID!!! FACT AND IF SOMEONE IN THE MEDICAL FIELD TELLS YOU THIS ISNT TRUE THEY ARE LYING TO YOU!!!!!!! I AM A NURSE WHO WORKS IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE.
1	A massive thank you to all the scientists & boffins who have come up with this vaccine so quickly!
1	Ok iam Sputnik v vaccine take it
1	More vaccines for the ones who want it. The vaccine is really good at making you asymptomatic so even if you get it from an anti-vaxxer, your chances of it not effecting your day to day are high.
1	Just get vaccinated so we can all go back to normal life. Please.
1	You cannot reason with Anti-vaxxers.
1	It’s not bad for the country. Childish behaviour and refusing to get a safe and effective vaccine bc you watched a YouTube video and listened to a meathead’s podcast, is bad for the country.
0	What should scare you even more is it’s changing your RNA; your bodies blueprint and the changes are permanent and irreversible. Gates wants to depopulate by 3 billion. He plans on doing this with vaccines.
0	Vaccines don’t work, newsflash. I’ve known so many people who are vaccinated who have gotten covid. So where’s the logic? You live in fairy land inside your head.
0	What’s even rarer than the side effects from the vaccine? Actually dying from covid in the first place
0	I will not get vaccinated, I've seen people who have died from the vaccination, athletics have heart attacks not to mention the children, how does a 17 year boy have a heart attack and yes all were fully vaccinated.. people need to stop listening to fake news
0	20 people in one office, 17 vaccinated were infected with omicron and the 3 others ( not vaccinated) were negative ... true story, can u explain it please ??
1	Thanks for covering this story, Chris & Angelo! Perhaps it might inspire some of the misinformed and stubborn to vaccinate and save lives... not just theirs, but the ones they might infect.
0	No poison for me. Respect for protestors
0	This butcher now introducing vaccins. Not to heal you both to make you slave from medicine. Weakening your immunity and final kill you.
0	One's personal health should be one personal choice. Period!!!
1	It’s important that vaccines are delivered to countries with low vaccination records urgently, together with the means to get those vaccines into the arms of health care workers and the most vulnerable. Sending leftover doses to other countries can lead to wastage, and isn’t targeting the areas of need.
0	I know 2 people personally who've had bad side affects from the poison jabs. They're not vaccines they're experimental gene therapy
1	Great video. Sad this doesn’t have more views, people don’t want to spend 30 minutes to educate themselves
1	We shouldn't convice the unvaccinated to get the vaccine. We should wait for them to pass on.
0	A healthy person has got be vaccinated ,to protect vaccinated who are supposed to be immune now ,after a magic jab
0	A good friend of mine passed away from a massive heart attack the day after her second Covid shot. She was otherwise very healthy.
1	I am going to take it, just to be safe. My parents would make me anyway, I guess it is true though that people can choose if they have the vaccine but they have to accept that they might not be able to go to some stores and places that require you have the vaccine.
1	I had covid 19 and beat it......and still got the shot just in case. I don't wish this for anyone. Until you have it and realize what it does to you,  You really appreciate the little things in life.
0	They new all along this was nothing more than to shock and shame people in to getting the jab
0	My president Joe Biden told me to not trust the trump vaccine and that is why I am not taking. Now that we elected him they say it's safe 2 days after the election? I'm all set.
1	Hoping that unlike the other vaccine Moderna touted; this one actually works.
1	The more people get vaccinated, the safer we'll ALL beThe more people get vaccinated, the safer we'll ALL be
0	I would more likely stay safe by keeping up my personal hygiene, sleeping good and eating well, and do some sports. And use herbal ways to heal my body from covid, not vaccine
0	Some parents, they refuse to do [COVID-9 vaccination] at all. Their sense is 'It's not going to happen to me or my family'. Or 'It will be mild in our kids, and the vaccines pose some risks.'
0	I don't know the long-term effects of these vaccines therefore I can't take it
0	Just remember the vaccine DOES NOT STOP TRANSMISSION. The vaccinated CAN still spread covid. They are no different than the unvaxxed when it comes to transmitting covid.
0	Make your children a favor and protect them from getting vaccinated!
1	Your reply and info is appreciated. So much clear info re covid-19 and vaccines means I will get vaxxed.
0	How can anyone say a drug that doesn't have any long-term test results yet is totally safe? That's the main reason I'm skeptical about it.
1	Good thing we can trust the science on the vaccines
0	that is aweful to hear! i am unvaccinated and proud! no need to gamble my health for something i dont need.
0	I'm immuno compromised, and I believe that people should be allowed to refuse vaccinations for themselves, and their kids. I don't get vaccinations myself, and even if I was capable I still wouldn't
1	This virus was already known thats why they were able to develop a vaccine, trust the science!
1	As for the risk of vaccines, the risk of any serious adverse effect from the vaccines is far lower than the risk of death from covid-19 in any age group And we have far more idea of the risk of long term adverse effects from the vaccines than we do long-term effects of covid-19
0	That's because the injection is NOT a vaccine! The reason it is called a vaccine is so that the pharma cannot be sued for damages when the inevitable deaths and serious side effects manifest themselves.
0	No- we are not vaccine “hesitant” , we are saying no to a shot that doesn’t do anything to impart immunity or prevent spread of a cold.
0	Too bad they didn't do their research instead of taking their word for such a kill shot.
0	the vaccines are dangerous
0	Imagine taking this vaccine
0	It’s all about the money. No reason at all to vaccinate
0	Great guy, and to be honest having had covid twice myself, unjabbed and then jabbed made no difference what so ever, so the 3 trial injections were for me a complete waste of time, and that bit at the end. Selfish.
1	Their kids are only "succeeding" at life because the rest of us are vaccinated. They're relying on vaccines, thinking that nature/God is working for them.
1	I'm going right now to take my jab !
0	I would rather get omicron twice than Thrombosis from vector vaccine
0	Funny how they didn't interview the patient in the next room who was fully vaccinated/boosted, and consquently disillusioned to the lies that it would protect them.
1	As a 13 year old who recently got my booster a few days ago and my 2 shot in may of 2021 and can confirm that the vaccine had ultimately no side effects on me. And I would strongly suggest getting it.
1	I would like to see more of this type of debate but more vs the anti vaxxers ATM. Good counter arguments and pointers to where to find good info on the more subtle details of vaccines
1	Such a damn shame that we can't give the vaccines to people that want and need it in different countries. This is infuriating.
0	I'm never going to take it personally I think there's no point in taking it because the risks are too high and I don't want to live on taking a new one every 6 months
1	Did you see the number of deaths and serious long term symptoms of the infection? If you don’t get vaccinated, sooner or latter you will get in contact with the virus without any protection. Do the smart choice and just take the vaccine.
0	Biden smiles and walks away when asked about responsibility for #COVID19 deaths and transparency about the origin of the virus. Say no to vaccine.
1	All these pissed off kyles and karens got multiple vaccinations as children and still crying
0	Woooow...Disasters...Panics, fears...Compulsory....Mandatory...What about the quality of medical treatment? We see that in some countries, like the Netherlands, with 88%, did not bring any result.. We have a new lockdowns, new measures, full hospitals....So the solution? When the first two did not work, let's continue with the third one....Let's make it mandatory...Logic? The governments are loosing any logic in this crisis management.
1	I have had both vaccines thank you to the scientists
0	Yeah coz no jab no work,kids gotta go to school and eat.i personally think she didn't have a choice.i can see deep inside her eyes she not happy
0	"WHILE THE DATA IS BEING COLLECTED -- THEY SHOULD RECONSIDER IT."   DARN.
1	It's been over 3 weeks since my first dose and I would like to get my second dose as soon as possible
1	I should shortly be offered a vaccine but may get a choice if I wait longer but now feel reassured that all the vaccines are effective.
0	Unvacincated and staying Unvacincated
1	I am getting the vaccine
1	#VaccinesWork #WearAMask #socialdistancing
1	The vaccine is the best way to protect yourself from the impacts of COVID-19. If you haven't gotten it yet, now is certainly a good time.
1	It is frustrating that people don't understand that vaccinations so far have kept a lot of people out of hospitals, even then relieving their own work situation.
0	My doctor said to NEVER give this vax or any to be honest. Glad I have doc I can trust to be honest.
1	Thanks, Doctor Mike. I hope America continues to donate your excess vaccines to developing countries. People are dying in my side of the world and we want to get vaccinated but no vaccines available.
1	I'm a trucker. I'm pro vaccine. These protests are making me ashamed to do my job.
0	We have empirical evidence showing that the vaccines do not work to protect people from contracting Covid.
0	I can't imagine any child being excited about having a needle jabbed into their arm.
1	Good to see the nurse aspirating that vaccine! Preventing an inadvertent intravascular injection is super important.
0	Doesn't seem like getting vaxed changes much. You can still get it and spread it.
1	I am proud the majority of Canadians, including truckers, already have had their vaccines!
0	I'm glad I wasn't in the experimental study
1	Getting vaccinated means that you look after yourself and also show consideration for those around you.
0	The vaccines are not lifesaving but are killing people and will be killing more people as each day goes by. This is a farce. The biggest farce ever in world history.
1	Motorcycle helmet is individual, but the vaccine disinformations have killed about 100,000 uniforms who follow some politicians like her. I felt bad for her family lost but having one less person to spread wrong information is crucial.
1	Yeah.. Vaccines are safe. It's called a side effect, you get side effecs on any medications. Hell, even panadol gives you side effects. The vaccine is safe, it will not cause you any danger.
1	All of my children and grandchildren had their vaccines with no problems AND no diseases! I am a believer!
0	Dude this is actually kind of awesome. Just seeing humanity go all-in. Maybe I’m thinking too much.
1	The only symptom my family had from the vaccine was a sore arm for about a week and tiredness for 24 hours.. my family is fully vaccinated and my daughter will be getting hers next week.
0	Why risk serious side effects for something that has a 99% recovery for non vaccinated ?
1	I'd ask why anyone would be dumb enough to do that in the first place, but...well they are anti-vaxxers.
0	Vaccine passports and mandates are nothing but a tactic to coerce people who haven’t already got their shot to go to get it.
0	Those vaccines aren’t safe and anybody worth their salt will avoid them. I live in U.K. and recently I’ve had 14 friends take the Vaccine...............now dead. One just 45 minutes after the shot.
0	The losers who got screwed with their multiple injections might switch to the term "pro-science" instead of "pro-vax". They've been in a permanent flight of fancy for the last two years. As soon as one of their arguments falls through, they use another.
0	Taking the vaccine in exchange for the hope on an easier progression of the illness, is like cutting off your leg to avoid athletes foot!
0	Exactly, Obomba said he is taking it on tv so people knows its safe.Same as Bush and Clinton.And then there is the monster himself (Bill Gates) Trust those killers, thanks but no thanks.
1	Covid might actually end or slow down if a mandate of people who are vaccinated can only go places but if not vaccinated just wear a mask; just wear a mask or GET VACCINATED (same thing as the flu shot nothing different!!!! It’s NOT GONNA KILL YA!!!)
0	Coronavirus vaccines don't work, so the CDC changed the definition of vaccines from providing immunity to "providing protection." Ever met anyone with polio? Measles? Whopping cough? Probably not, those are real vaccines, what's the difference? Think about it.
0	I still don't need a shot to reduce the symptoms of a virus that gives me zero symptoms.
1	I want one
1	It cracks me up that people are saying, "but I had a sore arm." Well, when you jab a metal syringe into a muscle, you have to expect that. Political views aside, I'm a type 2 diabetic, so not even a question as to whether I should have gotten it. None. Benefits far outweigh the "risks."
0	Asking vaxxed person less than a year about long-term effects of vaccine is as useful as asking smoker after a year of smoking whether they got cancer.In 1st case nobody knows or guarantee anything (with mRNA/VV vaccines),in 2nd case you are very likely to develop cancer later.
1	It’s amazing, and should be something we are all excited about. A HUGE advancement in the medical field and will change the future of vaccines. It’s a shame partisanship and drama is putting a damper on that.
0	they will hide behind the fact that the virus has mutated from the original strain, which the vaccine was designed to prevent. Of course they won't say a word as to why they are still giving this same vaccine out to address current and future strains, none of which are the strain that the vaccine supposedly protects against.
0	The main reason for not wanting to take it is suspicion that all the safety data is not available, and that the vaccine was rushed to production.
0	Just because yu got it and was okay doesn’t mean it’s not safe for other people yu are one person in a billion…..
0	Questions about getting an untested vaccine that offers no protection and doesn't lift your restrictions and concerns about side effects and complications is just COMMON SENSE.
0	Joe Im FUCKING pissed! Im being rejected from going to the gym. Im Not vaccinated, and I havent been sick. Im wearing a mask Like everyone else! Wheres the freedom of america gone??
0	The COVID-19 vaccine has not gone through the same long-term testing that other vaccines have and it is only certified for emergency use. It is barely a vaccine and there is still a lot we don't know about it. This isn't just a flu shot and it should not be treated like one.
1	As a scientist I am really proud of my collegues that worked on the development of these new vaccines
1	I've got 3 moderna shots ! And I feel fine.
0	if I'm expected to take the vaccines because I'm responsible for strangers' health, I suppose I also should be forcing them to exercise and take away their McDonalds, alcohol, and cigarettes as well.
0	Happening all the time now. Wake and listen to those of us who know the true science. Please! The shot does NOT prevent Covid!
1	Dear Anti Vaxxers...The enemy is COVID... not Vaccine..Just reminding you!
0	I will not take boosters. There is a reason your body doesn't constantly have elevated antibodies. It is not a healthy natural state.
0	No thanks. The jab gave me heart issues. NO WAY!
1	I took the the first and second Pfizer vaccines. On the first one, roughly 2-3 hours later, I felt like I was a bit high, then I just went to bed for a few hours and was fine.
1	Let's hope the vaccine is for the good of the people
0	The vaccin don’t work brother leave people alone
0	FUCK the vaccine The vaccine is the mission to slow down the asteroid with little booster rockets to harvest it from Don't Look Up Instead of just launching all our nukes at the thing when we had the chance I wish it didn't fucking exist
1	BigPharma new tagline “A vaccine A day keeps the pandemic away. BigPharma is here to boost their income by boosting the pandemic!!!!
0	Majority of people i know in hospital are the vaccinated! Never had a vaccine never will!
0	Good on him, great man. Her? Not so much. I’m not vaccinated, and I’m not getting vaccinated either.
0	That's all we need is another worthless vaccine that gives people the virus and lets them spread it to other people
0	Scientists and doctors can be bought just as easily as politicians.
0	Keep fit and healthy... Nothing the good old immune system can't handle.
1	I will continue to get vaccinated. A vaccine may come onto the market that only needs to be vaccinated twice a year. Who knows. I'm fine with keeping the infrastructure and the health system from collapsing.
0	These vaccines certainly do make you wonder..
0	So excited! Does anyone know how many dosages a month they can produce once approved?
1	I'm vaccinated.
0	I’m not for vaccines and proud of it.
0	FDA approved that doesn’t mean nothing when you still get sick and hospitalized like my mother from being vaccinated
0	What next, putting Fluoride in community drinking water!
0	Everyone has had enough of the governments crap. Freedom to all.
1	i dont really care for what boris has to say but one thing i can agree with, is yes, anti vaxxers are nuts
0	LONG TERM SAFETY? WHO KNOWS ITS ONLY BEEN A FEW MONTHS!!! Most vaccines are studied for YEARS in trials before being released to the general population.
0	Before the vaccine was available, none of my friends even got covid, and I'm the only one who did and I didn't even know I had it until after I got an antibody test weeks later. Millions have gotten sick since being vaxxed. I say you're full of shit
0	Is it true that covid vaccine gives you ringworms?
0	I learned as a child that it is always better to learn from others mistakes, than to make them yourself. So always remember those interviews from antivaxers in hospitals!
1	Unvaccinated people continue to face the most risk from Covid. Simply put: The more of them get vaccinated, the fewer will wind up in the hospital.
0	vaccinations don’t work silly
0	That's great! Kids can put this in them even though they are virtually unaffected by Covid
1	I have taken the vaccine, never felt healthier and stronger
1	The fact that anti vaxxers think it's better for their child to die then to get vaccines is insanity.
1	Lots of anti vax coworkers at my company are gonna lose their minds and I am SO FUCKING HAPPY
1	i'm going to get vaccinated now
0	Biden said there would be death for the unvaxxed. I am still here. I feel ripped off. The rona is 12 hrs behind me
1	Not a single unvaccinated person should be allowed in a hospital when they get sick. Just put them in a circus tent, and let the show begin. It is time to stop endangering our medical staff. They have made their choice. And if tracing finds they have infected people, they should financially pay the price.
0	Never getting the shot
0	You need to develop a vaccine that does not put people at dangerous risks of blood clots, strokes, anaphylactic shock, bells palsy and heart disease.
1	It is amazing that modern medicine is able to do this.
0	another day still happily unvaccinated. ^_^
0	I've spent thousands of hours studying the "vaccines". I know much more about them than you do, because I put the work in, while you trust Pfizer, Fauci, Biden, Boris and whatever other Left Wing Rats you look up to over there in the UK. ALL major virologists agree "YOU CAN NOT VACCINATE YOUR WAY OUT OF A PANDEMIC". I will leave it to you do educate yourself on why that is true.
1	The technology used for AZ vaccine is not new. The mRNA technology used for Pfizer vaccine has been in development for 5 years and we were just lucky it was at a stage where it was ready when covid came along. Yiu know it's being looked at a potential cancer vaccine I'm sure.
0	Given the fact the first two shots failed, why would someone sign up for 3rd dose?
0	I'm hesitant and I'm NOT an anti vaxxer, legit AM NOT and have gotten every single vaccine ever required but I don't think "Get the vaccine or lose your job" (which is starting, and I LOVE my job) is cool at all
1	Keep on rolling out the Covid-19 vaccine
1	Amen Preach Bishop Covid 19 is being spread through the unvaccinated. Why people can’t see that? They are letting Satan blind them from truth.
0	If you are so called fully vaccinated you can still catch covid and spread covid because the injections literally dont work so it makes perfect sense to mandate injections that are unable to prevent what we claim we're trying to prevent. Gotta love this newly created covid clown world.
0	Is it a misinformation when someone's husband had a blood clot after getting their 2nd shot? so it's a NO for me!
0	A person, "Not government, should be the masters of their own fate to decie what to put into their body
0	The Government has no right to tell  me what to do with my body. If the Government was so concerned with the health of the people, it would work to reform the entire food industry.
1	We could all use a rise in morality. Yay for vaccines!
0	Two weeks after having the first Pfizer vaccine, my father was in hospital with his first ever heart attack.
0	Instead of violating our rights or releasing more useless vaccines, just improve the hospitals and hire more doctors!
1	I got the AZ Vaccine today.  I'm glad I got these side-effects. It means the vaccine is working!
0	It was rushed and prematurely authorized. The FDA has financial gains in this jab. I WILL NEVER TAKE THIS! Natural immunity for me
1	Get the vaccine, it'll protect you from covid, but it won't protect you from the unvaccinated, who'll give you covid, even if they haven't got covid. 🤔
1	Of course, you have the freedom not to be vaccinated. But this freedom is exercised to the detriment of those who will not have the freedom to seek treatment for anything other than covid.
0	we understand VERY CLEARLY just how poisonous these vaccines are.
1	The vaccine is safe. You will be fine.
0	I’m double vaxxed and was way sicker with Covid than my friends who got it that weren’t vaxxed. Plus I was the only one in my family who got the virus and I’m the only one vaxxed!! Please stop with the vaccine. It obviously isn’t working.
1	If vaccines are unused and not expired, please donate them to the 3rd world countries. While the US people get vaccines for free, mRNA is so expensive for us. Govt can only afford some portions, not for the entire nation.   For us, it is strange to see the large percentage of people in certain areas in the US decide not to get vaccines. For us, it is not just the fear of getting infected; what is more important is the fear of spread covid to our loved ones, the elderly people, and the weaker individuals. It is a common sense and responsibility  to society.
1	You gamble with your life but don’t spread lies and misinformation about a safe vaccine. Also don’t infect vulnerable people who could die because of you infecting them. Also if you get severely ill from covid please refuse hospital and ICU admission
1	Thank you Science!
1	The vaccine keeps your symptoms MILD if you get Covid and keeps you OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. No different then the Flu vaccination. You can still GET THE FLU even with the vaccination BUT symptoms MILD
0	I know people who struggle to sleep, have had constant headaches , 2 strokes and one death after being vaccinated.
0	You can't prove covid is airborne, so I will not wear a mask
1	I have Crohns and UC. I got the Maderna and I'm glad that I got the vaccine. I have lost family and friends who didn't vaccinated
0	Natural immunity all the way
0	This vaxx is in clinical trial stage until 2023. The very act of taking it you participate in a clinical trial. Emergency powers had to be passed to allow the rollout. That isn't the case in the examples you cite.Previous vaxx have been properly tested & approved over many years
0	No it doesn’t. The vaccine doesn’t keep you from getting COVID. Where are you getting your facts? Facebook?
1	Dr should be ashamed of himself for letting believe vaccine is not needed...
0	2 years of not wearing masks, no vaccines, no nothing and I still haven't got it. According to “experts” I'm VERY lucky so I'm going to buy a lottery ticket tomorrow
1	Humans will have to a take shot every year.
1	Not against the vaccine, against forcing people to take it without them becoming second class citizens while huge corporations profit from it
0	There should be world wide protest about what’s happening in Austria. It’s only a matter of time that we start locking down the unvaccinated. This is a major human rights violation.
0	I’ll pass on the pop control shots
1	I cant wait for the clubs to open
1	Me, my sister, husband and mom all got our second shots. No problems. All good!! I’m happy
0	The bottom line is, these shots are very much still in the experimental stage. There are still many things that are unknown.
1	"My own research" simply means "I went on Facebook, read some BS and now I'm an idiot".
1	Vaccines prevent the spread of the virus and are safe to use.
0	The government has no authority to mandate anything!
1	These new vaccines are the stepping stones to some great advances in medicine coming our way. This is an exciting time in biotechnology.
1	Every vaccination will save that many more people from suffering needlessly. Where I live, for example, the infection rate is about 1.32, meaning every infected person is infection just over one additional person, and so on and so on, so every person who instead gets vaccinated helps drive that number down. At your age if you have no risk factors you will barely experience any side effects from the vaccine. Delta, however, has been shown to make even young healthy people sicker than the first strain.
1	Vaccines work. I was practically bathing in my sweet MM's aerosols 24/7 for days. PCR says, still COVID- Get your #CovidVaccine, get #Boosted, and #WearAMask.
1	I am passionately pro vaccine. Reasonable people however have had enough of the poor decisions
0	The reason why I’m not getting vaccine is because I’ve had family members get it and STILL get covid. Also it is literally a test to put on people. We are just experiment and I would rather not get something that I don’t know fully works which obviously it doesn’t.
1	If this was Sky News Australia, the anti-vaxer would be asking the guy questions
0	I'm an anti-vaxxer. I watched my child suffer from seizures after being given a series of vaccinations.
1	My wife and I are both triple vaxxed. We got covid 2 weeks ago, a milder case. Recovering now. I'm sure it would have been a lot worse without the shots.
1	Children are as likely to be infected with COVID-19 as adults and can Get very sick from COVID-19
1	Data never lies, it is the antivaxxers who do.
1	If you are unwilling to get vaccinated YOU are a menace to society!
1	Finally, I got my pfizer fully vaccinated already
1	The wider goal is saving lives as quickly as possible. People are still dying and they were much more before the vaccine. I recommend stop reading into it and thinking about who benefits from this and that. Just stay safe and protect the people around you.
0	My arse! They are not giving you vaccines! They are genetically modifying you!
1	Wrong, it’s 2 1/2 times more likely for someone with natural immunity versus someone that’s fully vaccinated that have never had covid. Natural immunity isn’t stronger. My best friend just died 3 weeks ago at age 34 unvaccinated.
0	It’s a bigger warning the vaccines are not vaccines they are a money making scam
0	Can you tell me how many doses do I need to be fully vaccinated for long-term protection? 1 dose? 2 doses? 3 doses? 4 doses? 5 doses? 6 doses??...
1	Yes of course we need the booster shot, why you are not reporting the side effects and the deaths from the vaccines for each country you mentioned that they started with the third dose of this elixir ???
1	These researchers are heroes. They should get the Nobel Prize.
1	If everyone gets vaccinated then we could go back to a much more normal life!
1	I got both my jabs and I was fine and Covid scares me and I had a friend who was anti vaccine and kept saying I’ll be fine and that I’m not putting strange toxic things into my body back in August she got Covid and sadly passed
1	If the vaccine protection against symptomatic infections linked to Omicron "is much weaker" than against the Delta variant, "the recall still makes it possible to significantly reduce the risk", confirms the DREES.
0	Injecting aluminum and mercury to avoid flu symptoms.... ohhhh science.... you effeminate douche bags can stick that poison up your communist ass
1	Vaccine and booster works. Get your vaccine please..
0	Why did they require people to sign a waiver if the vaccines are safe?
1	Novavax is a protein-based vaccine that experts hope will also persuade anti-vaxxers to get inoculated. We also look at the vaccines available and how they work. Plus: We meet a nurse who is refusing to get vaccinated. On this COVID-19 Special, we look at the different available vaccines
0	Just keep talking the poison.....
1	Almost all vaccines do not prevent 100% transmission or infection. The Covid vaccines are vastly safer than Covid itself.
1	Just get the vaccine. What risks are there? You want people to stop telling you to put your mask on right. You want this to be over right? How do you think we got rid of smallpox? Hmmmm? Exactly. If we all just do our part we can be done with this virus that is clearly real as we can see. Just because the death rate is really low does not mean you are safe. You can still get long term side effects from this virus. Like unhealthy lungs. Ok, so just don’t be stupid and be smart. You either get the vaccine and do your part or you put everybody around you at risk and be selfish.
1	Fuss as you might about vaccine mandates, it’s great to work out & know everyone around you has been vaccinated.
0	We know how mRNA vaccines are made, but we don't know yet if any longterm effects. There are concerns with fertility. I question why healthy young people would need this shot when the recovery rate is basically 100%, unlike the recovery rates for diseases, in which we get childhood vaccinations for.
0	So let's recap. The vaccine has not saved many people, with variants that are increasingly harmless. On the other hand (and this is a coincidence according to the authorities), cases of HIV, mad cow disease, myocarditis, stroke, Guilain-Barré, etc. are exploding. Strange times...
0	I am having the EXACT same problem!! Last month I started breaking out in hives a week after receiving the booster. I tried everything to manage it and nothing worked. After seeing 2 doctors and going through a round of prednisone, I was still having issues and was told to see an allergist.
0	No!  No long term studies!  Also, not like other vaccines at all, brand new technology!  So many adverse affects and reports of death after vaccination.  Long term prospects look even worse.
1	im vaccinated and im fine. i do it to protect OTHER PEOPLE
1	Noooooo….!! It got me. Good job I’m fully jabbed = less severe illness, reduced chance of hospitalisation. #GetVaccinated
1	51-year old priest, Don Paolo Romeo, died of Covid. He claimed that Covid vaccines have cells derived from aborted fetuses & did not get vaccinated. His ultra-conservative positions were known and tolerated despite the Catholic Church saying the vaccine is morally legitimate
0	Something that is safe shouldn’t be mandatory. Wakeup people
1	Got my vaccine last week, my arm was a little sore but I feel great
0	VACCINE: ANY GOVERNMENT WHO AGREED TO LET THE PEOPLE BE VACCINATED FOR COVID ARE BRAINLESS. WHY WOULD A DANGEROUS VIRUS & MICROCHIP BE INJESTED TO PEOPLE? I KNOW, EITHER YOU CANNOT SEE THE TRUTH OR YOU ARE IN THIS EVIL PLAN DESTROYING THE WORLD AND HUMANITY!!
1	So tired of these self-centered people who think they are entitled to infect others with a potentially deadly disease.
0	If you’re following the science, there was NEVER any good reason to be injecting our kids with an #ExperimentalVaccine from @pfizer .. #LoveOfMoney leads to all kinds of evil..
1	I just can't feel sorry for anyone who gets the virus and isn't vaccinated!
0	It works , but we can’t prove it, just trust... nice advertising
1	With the invention of various vaccines, antibiotics, and other therapeutic agents, the average life expectancy has increased dramatically in recent years.
1	it's a good thing so many of you are pro vaccine, because by 2030, they'll likely be mandatory for everyone
0	The same government people question are willingly taking a shot that government employees are exempted from lol
1	If you die of COVID because you refused to get vaccinated... you MIGHT be a dumbfuck.
1	Hope this changes the perception that vaccines are safe. They are not harmful.
0	ANTI-VAX PROTEST!!! GO TRUCKERS FOR FREEDOM!!
1	these idiots can’t admit that people who have gotten vaccinated aren’t dying. it’s the ones who won’t that are. all of these “the vaccine doesn’t work” assholes think they’re so fucking cute until they catch covid. then it’s all “gofundme” and “would have given the shirt off their back”. FUCK. YOU.
0	Here's the short answer to should you get vaccinated? NO!
0	I work in an office with 5 other people. 1 person is vaccinated and the rest of us are not. The 1 vaccinated person caught covid and brought it in. 2 out of the 5 unvaccinated people caught it and recovered within a week. The vaccinated guy was out for 3 weeks
1	Im in favor of this. If it’s really needed to combat delta variant why not. Im fully vaccinated with Pfizer and im willing to have a third dose for added strong protection.
1	Just give it to me
1	Stop making excuses people, just get your shot. Stop being selfish. Get this over with so we can go back to normal. No one is a magnet no one has any issues you're all being childish and setting terrible examples for our historical future.
0	Thrombosis can be very serious, the vaccine could cause it, its dangerous
0	Just claim it's against your religion and youre all set.
0	I know people that have had heart attacks weeks after having their booster, why do you think the right to sue these pharmaceutical company’s were taken away?
1	Restrictions ar not gone yet because some idiots do not want to take the shot.
1	Coming from DR Congo where children still die from eradicated vaccine-preventable diseases I thank you for showing the importance of vaccination.
0	I wouldn't take it. The body heals it self. If they attempt to force anything on me, trust me, we will have a BIG PROBLEM.
1	The anti-vaxxers just scared of needles. It’s just sad lol
0	This is what Revelation 13 meant. So they forced everyone to receive the mark and those who doesn't have one, will not be able to buy or sell. Unless he had the mark.
0	They are trying to take your freedom
1	No shaming of others. Excellent stuff. I thought I was at risk due to medication allergies but after speaking to my doctor, she recommended the COVID-19 vaccine. I got the Moderna one and fully vaccinated since March. I didn't have any major side effects and I'm still doing fine
0	Then why are so many people being hospitalized for their symptoms of the shot if it’s so safe?
1	Vaccines work. When was the last time you thought of diphtheria? Or polio? Or smallpox?
1	Big pharm is making billions from this ‘virus’….this is why they are pushing vaccines..,this will never end…..between the elf, fauci and big pharm, they will keep this virus going forever…take a lesson from the Canadian truckers people…mad as hell and we’re not going to take it anymore….
1	What is wrong with these parents. God made children with a strong Immune system… Leave those kids alone.
0	My case of #covid: a mild sore throat and intermittent dry cough for two weeks. I’ll take my excellent metabolic health over an experimental vaccine any day. And gee, no side effects like #myocarditis or death. Just a healthy immune system.
1	No excuses! Vaccinate for everyone!!
1	To those who are deep in conspiracy land, they will just use this as further evidence.
0	Hands off our kids!!!!!! Kids are not lab rats!!!
1	This js unexpected that EMA give approval before the UK as much of the trial and manufacturing is done.in.thr UK this is good news tho this jab is cheaper and the requirements on cold chain is not as much as the MRNA
0	If it worked, mandates wouldn’t be a part of the discussion.
0	I don't take flu shots and never get the flu. Haven't had the flu in 20+ years. The body is smart and natural immunity just works! Millions upon millions have contracted covid and survived, but they don't want to talk about that part of it. They only want to focus on 1% of severe cases. What about the 99% who get it and still survive!
0	And what if you didn't inject yourself with crap, and left your immune system alone
1	I’ll take my chances w/ a vaccine which is basically a flu shot. I was in the military and I’ve gotten plenty of vaccines that were way worse. To each their own. But don’t complain about wearing masks if you refuse the vaccine.
0	How can anything  be said to be safe and effective- when it hasn't been adequately tested??????
0	Kinda funny how the  COVID "misinformation" almost always turns out to be true.
0	The devil is working behind the scenes..don't trust these you call WHO or scientists..Trust God who will heal all you diseases
1	@JoeKoffee Whatever Joey, I got vaxxed for you.
0	No children should be getting this “vaccine”
1	Screw it. The data is clear: not getting a #Covid_19 #vaccination is practically suicide. #AntiVax types are hard-core anti- #science nuts. They're begging to die. Taking #JoeRoganExperience off #Spotify won't do jack. At this point, it is some needed Social Darwinism | #Opinion
1	Hell no! I would never give it to my 10 month old!! Nor would I give it to my other kids. My children are not experiment’s
0	This poor lady seems like such a beautiful soul. I pray she and all the people who have been harmed by the vaccine make a full recovery.
0	Pathetic globalist vaxx propaganda
1	My want to work at Pfizer now
1	All vaccinations should be mandatory. Jab or prison.
1	I know vaccines may be scary because they’re not perfect but they do work and help. I also agree about why its important and how it can affect those who can’t get vaccinated.
1	I'm proud to have been given your product, actually all my family have and we feel healthier than ever. Thanks BioNTech!
0	I thought the vaccine should have done that in the first place
0	Can you explain why these vaccines seem so "leaky," with many vaccinated people still getting covid, and why the boosters are needed? The effectiveness seems very short-lived.
1	I am fully vaccinated and the peace of mind I feel is the opposite of the helplessness I felt for so long. Living with a fully vaccinated person as well. I'm very grateful.
1	I just got the first vaccine. My arm is a little sore (the same amount of soreness I get from a flu shot). That's the only symptom. I feel perfectly fine otherwise!
1	I treat my vaccines like my game consoles and wait for the pro version.
1	There is no one in our entire hospital here for any vaccine related issue, half the people in my hospital is here for COVID related issues.
0	On the vaccines, I have not had them. I’ve had a few vaccines, way back. Didn’t have real good results.
0	5g towers are covid 19. vaccines are the activation key the need
0	Inflated vaccine efficacy with naturally exposed vaccinees?
1	I am glad that my family and I got our vaccines! We did not experience any side affects either!
1	The term "vaccine skeptic" is such a wash ugh I also hate the "it is not one size fits all" absolute gold fish brain
1	Agree - everyone get vaccinated and get boosted I have. Never thought any of my family would test positive until my niece did. Thinks she picked it up at the supermarket, that`s how easy it can be contracted. She is well now, lesson learned - "take no chances".
0	But if you do not take the vaccination you have a 99.97% chance of Not Catching the Cvd19... This is Called PROPAGANDA
1	Minnesotans have the tools to fight COVID and keep each other safe and healthy.   Let’s keep using them.   Get vaccinated, boosted, tested, and wear a mask.
0	Old friend of mine, double vaccinated, got  Covid at Christmas, so didn't bother with booster after recovery. Very shocked now to be refused entry to Spain on grounds of 'not being sufficiently vaccinated
0	So glad I didn't have the failed AZ jab. Seems like it doesn't actually do anything.
0	So he got the Jab and like to Died ! Rehabilitation  and the rest ,yet saying  its ..Ok ..That's Dumb  ...
1	I support vaccines  100% and strongly recommend every one to get vaccinated!
1	I'm fully vaccinated against deadly cov19 virus no side affects at all I'm feeling great,thank you,
1	And the anti vaccine crowd still promote their nonsense. Should be rounded up and forcibly vaccinated
0	People don't know what the government is injecting into their bodies
1	I really hope that the COVID vaccine rollout helps illuminate just how ridiculous the anti-vaccine movement is to the point where it just sort of fades away into nothingness
0	A child killed by the Vaccine is bad
0	I am 67 years old and had covid in March 2020. In March of 2021 had my first vaccines. April 2021 had my second vaccine. A few days after became ill. When I say ill I really mean it. 9 months later I am still sick as hell. In and out of hospitals, doctors, countless tests, blood tests and more. Haven't driven in over 5 months. And everyone agrees, main stream media doesn't say anything about this. And as far as people dying from heart attacks and strokes, that is ashamed, but we are talking covid and this stuff is real and it is happening to real people. Everyone should wake up and be careful.
0	Since the 1st, 2nd and 3rd shot didn't stop covid the 4th will says crazy people
0	Ruled by fear, people forget they have an immune system.
0	Welcome to the club. Enough is enough. The more people get natural immunity, the control goes away.
0	Yall getting injected with something that isn't even preventing the virus
0	So people who have already gotten it have natural immunity that's something that they don't like to talk about because it's free
0	When India launched the Covid19 vaccine in January 2021 most Indians refused to take the Covid19 vaccine...
1	So out of 7 million people, 6 people developed an adverse reaction. Of those 6, 1 died and 1 has been hospitalised. How many of those 7 million would have died of covid though, had they not been vaccinated. I fear that figure would be way more than 1 person.
1	I recommend you all to get your shots!
1	I had my first vaccine injection on Friday at River Lodge surgery. I would like to thank you for the speed of the date given, the very efficient way it was carried out and the friendly and courteous way that I was treated by all the staff, it was most appreciated
0	The various extreme & adverse side effects, long term side effects, and rising death count are NOT so rare !!!
1	I was legitimately astonished when I heard someone say "they put some of the disease in the vaccine!?" Yeah, how did you think they made it?
1	All drugs have side effects, but the benefits far outweight the possible risk.
0	I am not avoiding to not getting the covid vaccine. i just don't believe in getting the covid vaccine. so, i won't get it.
1	All vaccines show to be effective with the omicron in that when infected, your symptoms will be mild.
0	Vaccine hesitancy is created by WHO by giving sequence of contrasting statements to cover their mistakes.
1	With all those people against vaccines, science and doctors I really wonder how humanity managed to progress so far this much!
0	Vaccine = deadly
1	I don't want to die from covid, ofc I am vaccinated
0	FK u Idiots. What a fraud. It does nothing to help people. #faucifraud #vaccinehoax
0	Good sign, then. Here's to hoping nothing untoward happens to the Phase II/III subjects.
0	I’d rather suffer from covid than get GBS. People survive covid every day, but being paralyzed for life is terrible.
0	Scientists and doctors can be bought just as easily as politicians
0	Taking the vaccine in exchange for the hope on an easier progression of the illness, is like cutting off your leg to avoid athletes foot!
1	In New Zealand they actually have an ad played regularly on the radio with a young woman who says I checked with my GP and my obstetrician also talk to my midwife and they said it was perfectly safe for me to have The Vaccines so I've decided it's the best thing to protect myself and my baby
0	Italy's doctors (most of them) refused to vaccinate..
1	You can still get Covid after vaccination, but it would very possibly not be as severe, which could mean life saving. I am fully vaccinated, feeling ok with the vaccines.
0	I’m still not getting vaccinated.
1	Such a damn shame that we can't give the vaccines to people that want and need it in different countries. This is infuriating.
1	Good stuff! I experienced no symptoms except a sore arm. My brother did get a mild sickness after his second shot. The vaccine prompts an immune response, so that is in fact perfectly normal.
1	I am fully vaccinated and the peace of mind I feel is the opposite of the helplessness I felt for so long. Living with a fully vaccinated person as well. I'm very grateful.
1	Anti vaxxers will be triggered.
1	Any vaccines that prevent plauge-like diseases should be mandatory.
0	When my mate who is a pharmacist is telling me not to get it I tend to trust him over any government.
0	Let's think for a moment, should I be a sheep and take the death shot, ok now that I have thought about it NO
1	I believe that everyone should have the vaccine as it could keep them out of the hospital and slow the spread of the virus.
0	any parent that gives this crap to their kids is failing them on every level!
1	I am NOT an Anti-vaxxer.
1	I would say it is MORE safe than a traditional vaccine.  This isn't entirely accurate an explanation but close enough:  A traditional vaccine either carries a weakened or inert virus. Your immune system recognizes it, and attacks it, but because it is either a weakened version nor an inert one, you don't actually get sick. Now that your body knows what the invader looks like, when it sees it again it can attack it much more quickly and you don't get sick.  The two methods currently available for covid vaccine take a different approach. The virus contains a specific protein that allows it to enter your cells and attack it. The vaccine has a piece of genetic code that tells your cells to create this protein. Your immune system then sees that protein and attacks it. Like the other approach, now when it sees the protein on the actual virus, it know how to attack it and kills the protein much quicker. Without the protein, the virus is unable to infect your cells and eventually dies.  So two benefits:  The vaccine doesn't actually contain the virus itself Because your immune system attacks the protein and not the virus, the virus can mutate to some degree and you will still be immune. So from what I see, this is a far superior approach and safer. The allergic reactions that are being reported seem to be related to peoples fish and egg allergies which are ingredients used in the vaccine, but I've not seen a conclusive report on this yet
1	You people better get Vaccinated before it's too late.
0	actually doctors don’t say it safe. It’s not being promoted by people in the medical field. Only by global banking, mega corporations and big pharma
0	Curious if this data accounts for deaths within 14days post vax where it is recorded as unvaxxed deaths.
0	Me and my girlfriend are not taking it
0	Everyone freaking out over whats IN the vaccine I’m worried about the long  ass needles.
1	Just get vaccinated ppl it’s free like why not
1	Give me. Freakin break !!!
0	why my healthy 19 year old niece got a heart attack after the Pfizer vaccine? Why is it people like my niece never get to tell their story? She is lucky to be alive but her life is forever changed.
1	I got first dose vaccinated and the side effects was a very light fever and headache
0	Vaccine is a dead thing created by soon-to-be-dead humans.
1	Please, Darwin....do your thing!!!
0	Its NOT A VACCINE, this is pure guilt tripping propaganda, this has passed NO SAFETY TESTS, and is still in the stage 3 trials which don't end until 2023, then there's stage four 🤷♂️, and they completely missed out the animal testing. YOU ARE THE ANIMAL TEST SUBJECTS!!
0	I have never met a smart antivaxxer and that's the honest truth
1	Thank you for creating this video. It's very frustrating to read all the anti vaccine comments all over the internet. Even here in Switzerland, where we supposedly have very good general education there's an alarming rise of people spreading misinformation.
1	It costs nothing. It takes ten minutes. It is safe. It works. GET THE FUCKING VACCINE or get the fuck out of my scene. We don't put people at risk. Not on purpose. Not when we can protect each other. It's that simple. GO. GET. VACCINATED.
1	If you think the vax is slowing down the spread with any real significance you're not paying attention.

1	Get the f vaccinated. It is the right thing to do.
1	I’m getting my vaccine tomorrow
0	My daughter has several friends that after getting one of these "vaccines", their cycle is a complete wreck now OR some completely stopped having their cycle altogether......25-30 year old women. Sorry folks---that's not normal for a "vaccine"......
0	Why are they pushing this so Hard ????  My decision !! My life !!!!
0	covid vaccines don’t work, how many shots do you gotta  take
1	I will take the shot because I care about my country!
0	I think it's time for the medical profession to stand up against these mandates .
1	Got my vaccine today. No horrific side effects. Just felt a little strange. Get vaccinated!
1	99 percent of people dying of covid in hospitals are unvaccinated.
0	I found a box of covid-22 Pfizer vaccins from 1998. Absurd
1	The benefits outweigh the risk by so much to get the vaccination.
1	It is commonsense for me to get vaccinated, wear a mask, social distance, and live a healthy life.
1	It's more safe than almost every other drug we have in the market. If you don't consider this safe then basically you can't use all of the other medication we have on the market.
1	J & J... One and Done!
1	No amount of data or proof will be enough for the antivax idiots. They are willing to die for what they believe in. And it honestly doesn’t bother me one bit.
0	YEP THIS PASTOR SPEAKS THE TRUTH CONCERNING OUR RELIGIOUS RIGHTS AND IS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO CHOOSE NOT BE BULLIED TO TAKE A POISION.
0	Remember the Names and Faces of all the lying liars that told you that the "Vaccines were safe" when your family members start dying. Show them the same mercy and kindness that they showed your family when poisoning your family!
1	The death rate is far higher for the un-vaccinated
1	People are absolutely NUTS!!! Grow up for goodness sake. GET THE SHOT!
0	You should never be forced to put something in your body if you do not want to. I do not care how safe it may be. You should not have to, especially if it only benefits yourself and nobody else. 99% survival rate. Lets just move on people.
1	It might be good to still get the vaccine. There are many strains of covid19
1	The news on children is mixed. On one hand (and fortunately), they are far less likely to get serious illness than adults (though that isn’t absolute - we do have deaths in children). On the other, vaccine development for children has been very slow and we still don’t have anything for the youngest age groups. I suspect that will change in the near future. For now, we don’t have any magic ways to protect them so I would take the same sorts of precautions that you do for yourself - masking in those old enough, avoiding crowds, particularly in indoor spaces and trying to limit contacts with those who are ill. It’s not perfect but it’s the best we can do.
0	A family member got the Pfizer shot. About a month later he was diagnosed with heart fibrillation. He had no heart problems before.
1	I did it so I could travel…. Still painful to do so. Do whatever you want!
1	I'm at the point where I just don't care about hearing these stories. I'm fully vaccinated with the booster and alive.
0	The White House just said they don’t have the vaccine mandate while forcing it on the rest of America. Btw it normally takes 10 years to get full fda approval
1	You can still remind your loved ones to get vaccinated. It's not late
0	I'm unvaxed...had the Kung Flu......Shook it off in a couple of days.....no biggie.   Chance I decided and was prepared to take.   So, as such, I will continue to maintain unvaxed status.
0	Power to the people from Ireland ie, no mask no vaccine no chip
0	I’m still not getting vaccinated.
1	Got vaccine today and ready to fight with corona.
0	If 'Covid' is as dangerous as you suggest and I've done nothing of what you've advised, why the f*ck am I still here, well, healthy and thriving?!  You promote the 'urgency' to get vaxxed for my 'own safety'. But how urgent is urgent? Seems plausible you're lying over something
1	Everybody, go get your shot. I have and I suffered no side effects.
1	True fact: Fully vaccinated people are less likely to develop long covid, have covid-19 for longer, less likely to require hospital treatment or be in the ICU, and so they are already helping to stop direct/indirect spread of covid-19 in many more ways than unvaccinated people.
0	my dads friend just received the jab and he said he's never felt sicker, wished he had listened to us now.
0	What kind of vaccine is only effective for you when someone else takes it?
1	Common sense. You cannot have the unvaccinated on these crowded ships!
0	Even if they don’t make it “mandatory” they’ll make it extremely difficult to live ordinary lives without one
1	I would rather listen to a flat earther talk about their opinions than anti vaxxer
1	Your chances of getting covid and dying or becoming a long hauler are MUCH greater than any issues you could have from the vaccine. There are people dying every day with regrets about not getting the vaccine. Dont be one of them.
0	Thought those POSION death clot shots we’re supposed to provide “ultimate protection” according to fraud Fauci
0	More vaccines means more money for Pharmaceutical Companies and more money for Scientific Advisors who work for big Pharma Companies.

1	Why in hecks name are so many people against these vaccines
0	Enough is enough, everyone needs to wake up
0	NOT ONE RECORDED DEATH FROM OMICRON ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
1	The only way through this, to get out of the state of emergency and to stop wearing these things [masks] is to get everyone vaccinated
1	I got vaccinated 6 months ago with Moderna, had shoulder pain for a day after 2nd dose and that was it.
1	Got my booster dose of Modern a at the  @AMNH  today.  You could say I had a WHALE of a time!
0	Safe and effective? OPENVAERS. Over a million reported AEs. 21,000 deaths. Early treatment, over 200,000 treated with safe, effective, non-patented generic drugs. Pushing dangerous vaccines that don’t even work. How do you sleep?
1	#China 's #Sinopharm to start mass vaccinations from end of December..
1	I'm a healthcare worker and I have my appointment to get it on Friday! I'm so excited.
1	yall are like "omg but you don't know what the vaccine is made of 🙄🙄" then drink 1L coke everyday
0	These side effects are a lot more common than advertised. I know several people in my personal circle suffering from heart conditions, blood conditions and even deteriorating eye sight.  I’m not sure who is suffering from genuine side effects and who is just getting old, but some of them won’t even consider looking into their conditions being an injury whilst the other half is furious.
0	The idea of a vaccine is not to prevent a virus
0	Next video will be about vaccines making me magnetic or how it's affecting my chakras.
1	I admit that it's hard for me to feel empathy with Covid deniers who are in intensive care now...
0	I'm not getting the shot
1	Wow! I'm fully a pro-vaxer yet still found I had believed one of the myths! It never sat well with me that I "knew" for a "fact" that vaccinated people can "still spread the virus" I'm so grateful for finally seeing perspective on this issue!
1	I’m getting mine as soon as it’s available for me! My grandmother for her first phizer vaccine today and is doing very well so far.
1	you can see that the vaccines work in the icu stats where the majority of patients are either unvaccinated or partially. yes a vaccinated person can still get covid but the difference is a slight cough maybe some fatigue as opposed to intubated in icu.
0	Pharma has become more infamous for generating treatment (guaraneed long-term profits) rather than cures. Which is why I'm against the corona vaccine.
0	Don't take chemistry. Defend yourself and your children naturally.
0	what do pro-vaxxers and anti-vaxxer have in common?   Neither will ever be "fully- vaxxed"
0	I find it hilarious that the first ad during this video was a Pfizer commercial lying to us about how many people they're vaccinating.
1	No vaccines are made to prevent anyone from getting any viruses. They keep people out of the hospital and prevent deaths. It’s not rocket science.
1	I wish this mRNA thing works out and we get to have faster and more effective vaccines for now on. The flu vaccine is not even 50% effective and this new vaccine is about 95% effective.
1	To those who think vaccines are poison, they have brains made of peas
0	We are the guinea pigs for the vaccine
1	Vaccination can lower the risk of getting and spreading the virus.
0	The side effects can kill you
1	And when you are lying in intensive care moments from death and the last words you ever hear are from your loved ones saying "If only he had the vaccine"
0	Why would you think its reasonable to get vaxxed after 2 years of Lies, Propaganda, lockdowns? I find it quite unreasonable to even entertain the thought of ever trusting those vile creatures in government again. They can write anything they want in this report, even If they release it. It might be some Kind of damage control report.
1	Soooo sickened & sad to see these unvaxxed/unboosted in our ICUs still 2+ years out…& their unrealistic families …signed, a 34+ yr CC veteran…God love my full time colleagues who’ve dealt with this devastation incessantly the past two+ years…God speed to our new grads who’ve known nothing BUT this ugliness among patients…& their unrealistic fams…
0	I'm not responsible for your health either. If you're worried, wear a mask, social distance or just stay home.
1	Because people do not get vaccinated, the virus can continue to spread strongly and therefore a great many people have to die. It is as simple as that.
0	No vaccines for me.
1	An unvaccinated medical professional is like having a preacher who hasn't been baptized.  Wake up people!
1	As a healthcare worker I am always amazed how the majority of the population can't do college level science  but are suddenly virology majors. I wish they had medical training and could comprehend the stupidity of their "expertise".
1	As we push through this winter, get your #COVIDVaccine to help keep yourself and others safe. Get #boosted if it is time. Visit aacounty.org/covidvax
1	Vaccines are an amazing technology that has saved millions of lives. And most of the people should get them.
0	Vaccine doesn’t work work  all the time. Still believe the vaccine Is NOT SAFE

0	There is no such thing as “breakthrough” Covid cases anymore! When people who have already had Covid and have had three shots are still getting Covid, pretty sure we’re past that term. It was a breakthrough case when the shot was 95% affected. It isn’t anymore. Move past it.
1	It was the first one available to me and I was overjoyed to have it. Also boosted with it. So far, it’s doing it’s job with zero side effects! Feeling very grateful for J&J!
0	You cannot trust the Covid19 vaccine as the number of deaths from this vaccine are pretty significant. The number of people having severe symptoms from this vaccine are in quadruple digits. Someone named Muthukaruppan Mani is acting like an expert on vaccines but he is from India. Your opinion has zero value. Please disappear from the Internet as it is not your invention.
1	Vaccines that changed your life: 1796 smallpox. 1885 rabies. 1890 tetanus. 1896 typhoid fever. 1906 TB. 1923 diphtheria. 1926 whooping cough. 1932 yellow fever. 1937 flu. 1952 polio. 1963 measles. 1967 mumps. 1969 rubella. 1974 chickenpox. 2021 Covid-19.
0	Why risk serious side effects for something that has a 99% recovery for non vaccinated ?
1	I love this ! I'm going now to get vaccinated
0	The VAXED Are dropping like FLIES! LMAO
0	Making money from people sick is a huge conflict of interest & I don't trust people I know that much let alone people I don't!!
1	Take it or you are stupid
1	Thanks to vaccines, dreaded infectious diseases such as polio have lost their terror today.
1	Restrict them like when parents refuse to vaccinate their kids and their schools suspend them until they do.
0	It’s fascinating how folks are masking up these kids and wanting to vaccinate them, essentially teaching them to live in fear of a risk of essentially zero.  This generation of kids will keep therapists busy for decades.
1	IMO people are leaving themselves wide open for a higher rate of covid fatality/long covid side effects over a rather big "IF" the vaccines even have any long term effects. I can't remember a time when people ignored known medical threats for what may come down the line.
1	I personally would be happy to have the vaccine.
0	Lol, vaccines are a joke!
1	Of course, vaccinated people can get sick as well. They just have lower chances of getting serious symptoms that leads to hospitalization. Thus, not overcrowding the hospitals for people who really need it.
0	I’m not for vaccines and proud of it.
1	So incredibly sad! It's the same over here in Germany. The unwillingness to get vaccined by a more than just a small group of people is so frustrating. How can people claim freedom for themselves and thereby force others to work until total exhaustion in intensive care units?
0	No it does not discriminate. 1 shot , 2 shots , 3 shots, 4 shots or none. Are all getting it. So when does the 5th came out
1	Incredible video. Literally just turned me pro vaccine, 100% brother
0	When you finally understand that it's not about health but about money, a vaccine costs 30 euros.
0	No they don’t work. Childrens hospitalizations started increasing once the vaccine was introduced for children. Boost their little bodies full of vitamins and nutrients not poison!
1	Thank you for the clarification. Other doctors have done the same. We can only hope that people understand the importance of the covid vaccine. For ages, vaccines have served us well.
0	Ive gotten multiple friends who have gotten covid the past months. The ones vaccinated had a terrible time dealing with the ilness. The ones unvaccinated barely became sick and felt fine after a few days.   Maybe its time to stop spreading fake news, mrna vaccines arent the awnser. Living healthy is ;)
1	Take responsibility! Get the Vaccine and help save your community, your family, and the World!
0	We don't need no vaccination! We don't need no forced control!
1	I had the Pfizer Vaccine, and I had a slight headache, runny nose, and felt tired, for about 3 days. But after that I felt fine, hey, it's better than dying!
0	Yes and we are expected to allow our children to get these vaccines??? People protect your child
0	My best decision was not to get a vaccine.
1	I dont know about you guys but I'm super excited to get my 4th covid vaccine!!
1	You're 1000 times more likely to die of COVID than vaccine side effects.
0	The terror is comming everywhere !
1	Keep these scientific articles coming. We need to convince people to get vaccinated. If it changes the mind of one anti-vaxxer then job done.
1	There are literally millions of children here in the U.S. that have safely been vaccinated. Please get your children vaccinated, as well.
1	covid vaccine reduce severity---It teaches our immune systems how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19.
1	If you already had COVID-19, you should still get a COVID-19 vaccine for added protection.
0	that’s strange. everyone I know who has the vaccine now has a perpetual cough, and keeps getting sick over and over again. I’ve been doing 60 hour weeks because they’re constantly calling in sick.
0	No, I'm not taking it. I have seen and heard too much testimony of horror stories. I don't really trust this new class of vaccine....I'm not an anti vaxxer, but I'm going to try and get away with taking the covid vaccine as long as I can practicing best safety methods. I have a high platelet count and many people have been affected/killed by blood clots after taking the vaccine, and I am susceptible to them. The risks don't outweigh the rewards for me, personally.
0	People please think about this hard before making a decision for your child!!! Is it Really necessary, the Jab I mean? I would say No Thanks, just my opinion
0	Those that wanted to be first in line to get the #CovidVaccine especially seniors thought their lives would go back to normal.  I tried telling them they were naive to think that.  I guess I was right.
1	Awwwww boo hoo hoo I don’t want the vaccines… What a bunch of snowflakes.
0	This is not a vaccine in the true sense of the word but experimental gene therapy....Thank God I was wise enough not to have it....it's toxic rubbish that is neither effective or safe.
0	They want gps tracking, injection, censorship, entry denial & general bullying powers. Anything that doesn’t support that “isn’t real.”
0	Until it gets approved by the FDA I have no reason to not trust it. Otherwise this is just a ruse.
0	That snake on your logo is killing humanity, spreading poison in the name of vaccination. Nkt.
1	This is great news for science
0	Why would I want to get vaccinated?
1	Yes, for God's sake. Please get vaccinated, keep your loved ones safe.
0	I got Covid. I survived. Didn’t even need a government shot to do so. Almost like our bodies are finely crafted machines that are capable of caring for themselves.
1	If people are afraid of the vaccine (any vaccine) just put them aside and keep jabbing arms. We want our younger people to start getting vaccinated.
1	I am more scared of the long term side effects of covid then the vaccine
0	I love myself just fine not stick in my arm no COVID infection
0	I got pericarditis from phizer and it’s been a battle in real life to speak out. Thankfully I have a great cardiologist and doctor but other than that, people treat you like a leaper for it
1	I’m a doctor. Get that booster. The strongest immunity looks to be a combo of post-infection and vaccine-mediated immunity.
0	The truth is already out, the "vaccines" do nothing to stop you catching or passing on covid, stay healthy, get plenty of vitamin d and zinc instead
1	i am totally pro vaccine because it makes everyone safer but it's totally valid to not get anymore vaccines due to bad reactions or illnesses that make it dangerous for you to get vaccines. but the part of the population that can get vaccined without high risks should (in my opinion) get vaccined so that we can reach herd immuntity and secure everyone
0	Don't trust it. They don't seem that effective. Don't think covid is that big of a deal.
0	Proves #CovidVaccine isn't working as promised. Not helping relief from hospitalization and moreso accelerating those vaxxed to meet their Lord.
0	Me and my girlfriend had covid 3 weeks ago. Happily unvaccinated.
0	I think if your planning on having a baby the vaxine would be the last thing you should be considering!
0	After you get your booster, you're going to need another one. After that one, you'll need another. Eventually, it'll be the side effects that get you, not covid. It's a roll of the dice either way.
1	I'm vaccinated. I have the Pfizer vaccines. I personally didn't experience anything other than my arm being sore with both vaccines.
1	Thank you John. You convinced me, and now, my son and I are vaccinated. Keep up the good work, and please keep me laughing out loud on Monday mornings watching you on YouTube (can’t afford HBO
1	The jabs definitely does Things just doesn't prevent infection or transmission. THATS HORRIFYING
1	It's not the deaths in those ages that are the problem. It's the 400,000+ people spreading a virus with an R0 of 7+.
1	I got the Pfizer vaccines but I plan to wait until COVAXIN is approved before I get another vaccination because I feel that COVAXIN would do the JOB
0	imagine getting four vaccine shots in a year and call us unvaxxed crazy. lol!
1	I'm fully moderna vaccinated, and I started sneezing a few days ago. I got a COVID take home test as a joke, and it came back positive. I'm convinced the vaccine is what made this so easy on me
1	Extremely proud I got it. My whole family did. It was to get back to normal. But unfortunately as a society we only move as slow as slowest member. And too be honest it’s exhausting. Time to leave them, and move forward
0	Agreed. I’m not going to be pro-Covid vaccine because Trump says. I’ve never cared what Trump did or didn’t do as long as he left me the fuck alone, just as I wish Biden would.  I’m also not scared and don’t wear a mask, etc. I had Covid.
0	These vaccines are putting people in the hospital with Myocarditis, blood clots and miscarriages.
1	They need to make it mandatory to get a vaccine
0	I have decided against the vaccine and because of this I will soon be losing my job in a care home, but thank you so much for this
0	Vaccines dont work!
1	The vaccine is safe, and it’s irresponsible to suggest otherwise.
1	Just got the vaccine! Only the first one. All I felt was tiredness and soreness! But I feel great!
0	Business not health.
0	Its about time we've had to opportunity to hear from some of the people who refuse to vaccinate. Now interview some other doctors in the state and others countries that disagree with the vaccine, that would be great 👍
1	USA is lucky to have all those vaccines and can go into get vaccinated whenever they want. My country, you have to fight to get vaccinated cuz everyone wants it here. I had to stay up until 5am to make my vaccination appointment and im getting my second dose tmrw finally
0	Vaccines are not safe. Covid-19 is no different. The coronavirus vaccines not only have aborted baby body cells within them, they turn a vaccinated person’s body into a kind of a nursery for viral super bugs that are vaccine resistant. They will shed from that person and become deadly, dangerous and potential killers for countless people.  Dr. Bossche, who BTW is pro vaccinations, is warning the world for an immediate halt of global vaccination otherwise we are unleashing an unstoppable, uncontrollable monster, - a bioweapon of mass destruction.  Dr. Bossche is saying covid19 vaccines are the wrong weapon. They are the wrong strategy that will lead to an uncontrollable monster.
1	But by not getting vaccinated, you're helping create mutations that aren't effected by the vaccine, or are condemning people who can't get it to death or worse - tens to hundreds of thousands of medical debt.
1	I would love to see her say what she said about the pandemic to someone who’s family member has died from covid
1	if you are not vaccinated, GET VACCINATED!
1	If ur vaccinated you're less likely to die or get long covid
1	shot 2 done right. Feel this one a little more than first shot but I was normal and will hopefully be perfect
1	Since there are lots of anecdotal stories here, I will tell mine. I got vaccinated months ago. I feel great. Hope you do too.
0	And it's up to people whether they want the jab or not. We all have freedom of choice!
1	Great news!! Interested to see how many companies that were previously silent now mandate vaccines for returning to work.
0	The vax is biological fracking
0	A vaccine is a cheat, in the game of life mother nature has other plans built into her design. Man up humanity and just get on with life to build natural resistance.
1	We all understand to get vaccinated will save lives but some people are crazy and will believe any off the wall thing it just the way it is not getting vaccinated will put more people at risk I applaud your effort in trying to get crazy people to do the right thing
0	The disturbing part is that they're only now doing any studies trying to figure out if these vaccines can cause issues with someone's fertility.
0	Uncertainties exist concerning the transmission post vaccination, and yes, the long term effects although expertly addressed in your video. The general narrative on the ground is that despite the clinical trials prior to release, the covid vaccine(s) remain largely experimental.
1	We have seen the results of people not taking the vaccine seriously. The vaccine has helped people fight second wave. Those who were not vaccinated have seen the adverse effect.
1	On the CT scan of the lungs of a vaccinated person, the lungs are almost normal, whereas on the CT scan of a non-vaccinated person the lungs are very damaged, everything that is white is lung damage, his life will probably never be the same again.
0	The pressure will be kept on countries plagued by corruption, the money generated by the #vaccinbusiness is huge and the kickbacks keep coming, it's just the biggest holdup of all time.
1	Don’t be a selfish dork, get vaccinated
0	The only vaccine I need is Jesus Christ
0	I agree I really DONT want the vaccination I HOPE I NEVER GET IT, my Dad won’t let me anyway
1	Vaccine works Vaccine Saves Lives Vaccine Brings Happiness .
0	It's interesting that leftists say 'my body, my choice', when it comes to k!lling babies but do not say the same when mandated experimental jabs are f0rced into them.
1	Vaccine needs to mandated those who are traveling, concert goer, technology co. hospital and-government employees, also private companies employees
0	KEEP YOUR POISON THUGS
1	This is really interesting, and hopefully. It can get it approved. Also other countries can sign up and produce it. It would be a great boost .
1	Finally a voice of sanity in this comment section. Thank you! We need more vaccinated people to combat the common enemy: Covid.
0	no i Am antivax so again. speak for urself
1	We strongly recommended #Covid19 vaccination for children 5 to 11 years of age. Find out how to get an appointment in your area: http://ow.ly/8Xb050HECsh
0	LOL, at 2mn she says: « I trust myself, I’m learning to be self-reliant and I ask as many people as I possibly can ». Great: are you a Doctor or a virologist? The "many people" you ask are they Doctors or a virologists?? Certainly not. So a simple advice: on scientific matters you need to trust..... (drum roll) scientific evidence! Which means the scientific consensus, not the "many people" surrounding you, nor 2 or 3 maverick scientists that only work for their ego. And a lesson for all self-satisfied Americans: being free is NOT trusting yourself in topics in which you are as ignorant as a child, this is knowing to find where the truth lies. No thanks required.
1	Wow! I’m fully a pro-vaxer yet still found I had believed one of the myths! It never sat well with me that I “knew” for a “fact” that vaccinated people can “still spread the virus” I’m so grateful for finally seeing perspective on this issue!
0	Why aren’t any media talking heads mentioning natural immunity or therapeutic drugs? There are many studies proving that natural immunity is superior.
1	Boosters are especially important now with omicron. There still seems to be good protection against severe disease with the first doses, but with omicron, booster also gives you protection against infection and improves risks of hospitalization.
0	What about them saying get the vaccine and you can go back to normal life
0	but the vaccinated are still getting sick and spreading the virus. So tell me again how this new “vaccine” works so well?
0	As long as covid proves to be a niche market, the highly paid experts, publicists and smooth talkers will strip mine it for every cent for as long as they can
0	You are mafia. They poisoning people and than asking them to take a vaccine which is even worst how time pass by
0	This is huge. We are in a #pandemic of the #vaccinated.
0	I'm anti-Vax and proud!
0	“Everything we do comes with a risk and vaccines are no different”  That’s what we anti maskers and anti lock downers have been saying since all this be started. This virus is sooooo far from being deadly it’s laughable how we’ve reacted to it
1	If you're concerned about the potential risks of vaccination, you have to weigh the potential risks of natural infection as well. The vaccines are safer compared to an infection.
1	vaccines are safe as a doctor and citizen of this country I will take the vaccine
0	I agree with Joe.  Got vaccinated from peer pressure.  Ruined my life.  Have had a ringing in my ears that will not go away that started 10 days after shot.  If you’re healthy like I was I would say skip it.  I’m miserable now.  Would have never gotten the shot of it wasn’t for family and media pressure.
1	Think about the risk of having a case of influenza, ON TOP of a case of Covid. That is why I am vaccinated against both. And to be sure, I still mask.
0	Yeah I really don't get it. It just feels off how hard they're pushing this vaccine, not to mention that all the "bonuses" come off as patronizing with a $5 gift card or some crappy fast food place. I'm for vaccinations, but not vaccinations that are released this soon with so little testing.
0	Quick, take our vaccine again so that pharma can make more money
0	Imagine being forced to get a jab that doesn’t protect you or anyone else
1	God brought him the vaccine,but Marcus was too blind to see
1	Yes. It’s not a joke. Without vaccines getting Covid is much more severe. Why do you think vaccines of past work. We’ve all had them. Shingle shot. MMR. you take your babies to pediatrician and they administer vaccines. It’s not a new concept just a new virus
1	I don’t understand why they don’t trust the doctor when they tell people to get vaccinated, but they trust the exact same doctor to treat them for the illness they could have been vaccinated against.
0	Stop the vax
1	For those who say I don't what's in it do you know what's in the everyday pills you take
0	It is about implanting people with chips or some other shit.
0	When the CEO's who made the vaccine won't even take it, then I am going to question it.
0	The truth about this from official reports hidden by the so-called media like LBC is that the vaccine makes zero difference. The severity of Covid-19 on a person depends on each individual & their health status.
0	The protected need to be protected from the unprotected, by forcing the unprotected to use the protection that didn’t protect the protected.
0	A majority  in hospital are vaccinated. A majority of the country is vaccinated. It has already proven that unvaccinated pose no more of a threat than those who are
0	Covid Misinformation is saying we have a pandemic of the unvaccinated when it is a pandemic of taking the JAB in almost every country except Florida! There are real side effects, and many personal sude effects dividing our country, just look around! The JAB is SATAN!
1	Great news! While I hope the J&J vaccine will be available when my number is called, I’ll accept whatever’s available at that time and like it
1	Help protect your whole family and slow the spread of COVID-19 in your community by getting yourself and your children ages 5 years and older vaccinated against COVID-19.
1	Hello, and thanks for this video! I'm a health care worker and have had all my vaccinations thus far, but have become a vaccine sceptic, due to being bombarded by the anti vaxx narrative. But, also, I must admit, it didn't help my scepticism the way that the government has imposed vaccinations on us so aggressively, I believe it should be a choice, not forced onto us. Anyways, I'm going to finally book my first vaccine shot this week, after seeing your video. I've had enough of the conspiracy theories and all the surrounding bs.
0	No 👎more " Booster " shots for me ! No Mas.
0	you're just seeing the general vaccine hesitancy that comes with inoculating your child with a biological agent you don't understand very well
1	WHEN WILL THIS END? When everyone who can is vaccinated & boosted!
0	I would love the explanation of how being vaccinated stops the spread..
0	You got to love when people who get the vaccine claim that they got sick from someone who hasn't received the vaccine lol
0	I'm quite sure it wasn't ever meant to stop transmission and all these people are just fucking liars.
0	I hope none of y'all take that vaccine and why would people need to take it if they're not even sick??
0	What’s the big risk about being around non vaccinated people??? Or having them enter your establishment??? Especially after said store owners are vaccinated??? Shouldn’t the non vaccinated be the worried one???  Please inform me someone
1	To stay safe every one should take vaccines. And follow the other rules.
0	I’m sorry but any parent who takes their healthy child for a covid vaccine at this stage is mental.
1	I was vaccine hesitant for awhile since I had covid 2 times and only got moderate symptoms but now with the rise of the delta and other variants I decided to get vaccinated and so far I am very happy with my choice and my ability to look past all this fake news crap about the vaccine!! Now I just gotta convince my dad! Wish me luck
1	The vaccine is so awesome! My veins glow in the dark!
1	Anti-vaxxers: exist . Black Plague: its rewind time
1	There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines cause fertility problems.
1	It's depressing how necessary this is, but here we are. Unfortunately, there are hundreds of thousands of parents that are willing to let their children die to something completely preventable.
1	I have a Rammstein concert in September so y'all better get your vaccination.
0	One day you will be sued for crime against humanity. Mark these words.
0	Oh boy, I bet I will have some haters commenting on this post.  I am one of those who have opted not to take the vaccine. My primary reason for this is that I want to see studies regarding long term side effects. It is much too early to know what this vaccine may do to human bodies as time passes.  Also, this is considered an experimental vaccine. I am not a guinea pig. I know there was a need for something to stave off this horrible virus early on, so I can understand rushing the vaccine. I have read that all the vaccines have been developed and tested by scientists and that it is said that it won’t cause harm in the long term. I am not satisfied with that answer. I want to know about possible side effects 2 years, 5 years, 10 years down the road.  I’ve been doing my research since this virus came out. I don’t proclaim to be a doctor or scientist by any stretch. But so far, I have learned that vaccinated people are catching and spreading the virus, just as much as unvaccinated people. They say the vaccine prevents people from having terrible symptoms and even death. That may be true, I just do not know. I do know several vaccinated people who have caught covid, but had milder symptoms.  Another reason I have not taken the vaccine is that all I do know just doesn’t make sense. Information changes daily. Wear a mask, masks don’t stop the virus. Lock down, don’t lock down. We have already gone through the masking and lockdown and it didn’t do one bit of good in keeping people safe from covid. So here is my question. Why should I take an experimental vaccine that doesn’t keep me from getting or spreading covid and nobody can give me information regarding long term side effects. These vaccines are not made to actually stop covid.  I’ve also read that vaccines can cause viruses to mutate. I can’t rattle off all the science involved in that, but several articles I have read indicate that to be true. Covid is not the only vaccine that does this. Others, such as the flu vaccine, do it too. Does it make sense to take a vaccine that will cause mutations and more variants of the virus?  The new vaccine coming out from Pfizer that is suppose to receive approval from the FDA has me raising my eyebrows. I don’t trust the FDA, look at what they have done with our medicines and foods. The stuff that goes into some of those things is pure poison to the human body. Also, why are GMO foods approved by the FDA? It’s all about money. But back to Pfizer. Did you know that Pfizer holds the record for receiving the largest criminal fine in history? They purposefully misrepresented a pain medicine that has since been removed from the market. How am I supposed to trust a company that did that? With all the controversy about the vaccines, why would I decide to take one that is manufactured by a crooked company? How do I know that it is safe? It is another rushed vaccine. Just because the FDA gives it their approval doesn’t mean that it is safer than any of the others. I’ve read that the human immune system is 13 times more efficient at warding off covid than this newest vaccine.  It is being pushed too hard. For a virus that has a 99% survival rate, what is the big to do over the vaccine? All this talk about carrying a vaccination card in order to get into various places is just ridiculous. That is just government controlling us. I have a right to say what goes into my body and what does not. The day someone comes to my door demanding that I take a vaccine will be the day when I know we are doomed, and our freedoms will be taken away one by one.  I’m not downplaying the seriousness of the Covid 19 virus. It is a nasty bug than has killed lots of people. The death rates are not too high with the new variant, comparably speaking. But it is still nasty. I take precautions against getting sick. I take Vitamin D and Zinc and Vitamin C and Vitamin A, all have been proven to help keep covid away. There are some other avenues that I’m looking at as well. I stay away from crowds and practice good hygiene. And I pray.  Basically, I don’t know enough about the vaccine to just blindly allow substances to be put in my body that no one can tell me won’t cause problems somewhere down the line. At this point, they are talking about booster shots for vaccinated people. How many booster shots will we have to have? One a year, like the flu? Or one everytime the virus mutates and brings about another variant? I’m just not up for that.  Those are some of my personal reasons for deciding not to take the vaccine. Knowing what we know about it, I don’t know why people get so irate with folks like me who are critical thinkers and want answers. It’s none of my business if other take the vaccine. It’s their body and their decision. And it’s no one elses business whether or not I take the vaccine. It is my body and my personal choice to take it or not.
0	The virus is man-made, seeks out people with certain chemical or biological markers, and attacks with "gain of function force" those who have specific maladies, DNA, or take certain medications. Hence, the attack on diabetics and others with comorbidities. I had an epileptic relative who died of Covid-like symptoms in the USA in October of 2019. He had a "mysterious form of incurable pnumonia". He took a whole array of medications for epilepsy but was otherwise healthy. I am the only one in my household who takes any form of maintenance medication and am the only one who caught Covid. We were all vaccinated. This is why Covid "affects everyone differently". This is a designer virus that is very smart and programmed to "gain function" when triggered.
1	Please stick with the mandate. I don’t want to work with anyone who refuses the vaccination and puts themselves before patients and other staff.
1	that makes me feel a bit better about my vaccinated self
0	I've personally lost people from these vaccines. I've watched the youth, teenagers specifically develop blood clots and have seizures after getting the second doses, one of them who had a seizure did so while driving and crashed into a pole in a busy intersection.
0	The vaccine is more dangerous then COVID virus
0	This is a new science for which we still don’t know the long-term effects that could result on the human body.
1	Received my 2nd dose today. #Moderna #COVIDVaccine #BuildingAntibodies
1	The unvaccinated are stealing our freedoms.
1	Glad we didn't have this kind of ignorance when the Polio vaccine came out or we would still be battling polio.
1	Antivaxxers fake negative results. Antivaxxers lie about getting the vaccine. Antivaxxers are trash. Garbage.
1	Sad people who think getting vaccinated is against their beliefs. When they die from Covid they can be sure very few will mourn them for being so ignorant.
0	Hearing that the vaccine mandate had been banned in Missouri is so good to hear'
0	People who get fired for not being vaccinated need to sue.
0	Why would I take a vaccine for a virus with a 99% survivability rate I have never got the flu vaccine and have never got the flu either this is also about control. Nothing Else
1	Yeah, anti-vaxers. I say let Darwinism sort them out
0	No more vaccination for me.
1	and I'm sure many unvaccinated people will be crying into their statistically higher than average chance of containing covid hankies after hearing they can't hang out with you.
0	No vax is even better in the study I did
0	Sooo why are they trying to shove a vaccine down our throat if they don’t know if it works?
0	Yet they forget to add it's still in trial till 2023 and they don't know the long term side effects. Also if it protected others and yourself then why still the need for masks and distance etc.
1	thanks for this video. I've been around family who are very anti-vax and I felt like I was becoming worried with all the fearmongering they were doing - I really needed this information to snap me out of it!   Sometimes people's thoughts turn into an echo chamber, and you never hear rational, well-researched points of reasoning. Thank you for this high quality video! I'll definitely be sharing it.
0	The talk of covid vaccines still not died down yet? I got bored of this a while ago.
1	It’s amazing, and should be something we are all excited about. A HUGE advancement in the medical field and will change the future of vaccines. It’s a shame partisanship and drama is putting a damper on that.
1	Vaccines are most effective with public saturation. We didn't need vaccine mandates to get rid of Smallpox because Americans at the time wholly embraced doing it as a civic duty. Smallpox is extinct, eradicated from the Earth. Some other countries, at the time of the global vaccination effort for Smallpox, did enact inoculation by force. America did not have to. These modern mandates are not even forcibly making people get them, though people act like they are. Too many of these people still want to act like petulant children with their benighted beliefs in junk science, while charlatans try to sell them snake oil alternative remedies.
0	You know what is really killing people? Medical malpractice.
1	People before the new vaccine: ugh wish companies would develop a vaccine faster Companies: develop a vaccine faster People: now I don’t want it
0	Texas judge blocks Biden's federal vaccine mandate. UK government backing away from NHS jab mandate. Czech Republic u-turns on mandatory vaccine. A lot of good news this week.
1	Brilliant! And concise. Thank you. I've had my 2 vaccine course and booster. Yes... I am nearly 55... so called vulnerable age group. But why shouldn't we be protecting 'vulnerable' people in our society? Are we not compassionate Democratic societies? Isn't that the compassionate thing to do? Mothers, Grand Parents, Aunties and Uncles. Don't they deserve a long happy life too or... if you are 'Old' you are finished? Yes, younger people have a better immune response. But does that mean that they are entitled to risk the health of people that don't? Even if their 'Freedoms' are temporarily restricted? I am commenting on this 2022. Vaccines aren't about control;. They are about saving lives. Conspiracy theories? What's the point of intentionally depleting your workforce if you are a billionaire? A Government? Won't they miss the tax revenue of older people who die from this? You're damned right they will! So it doesn't make any sense. It's worth keeping the working classes healthy and alive. Isn't it? Good job ASAP. The benefits outweigh the risks. Thats why I am here, at near 55, to say that Influenza, Chicken Pox, The Measles, Tetanus, Polio and all those other life changing illnesses didn't see me off before I was 30. Why do you think life expectancy has increased ? Science baby! It's about adding to your own natural immune response. For infections that you have no antibodies to protect you from. Unless you have a pre determined risk, please, vaccinate. I want to hug my Mum again Unmasked. Without risking killing her.
0	Don’t people understand they don’t care they want us to be dependent on them I wish people would see this
0	All of this should have been answered before the vaxxxines were released. We had several extremely effective treatments that were block so big pharma could make fast billions.
1	Get these COVID-19 vaccines out asap and let's get the economy back open full steam and live events going everywhere including sports, music, theater, dance, etc.
0	The funniest thing is they would say “we have no idea how long natural immunity lasts, so get this vaccine when we don’t know how long the immunity lasts”
0	Why they don't mention about the nanoparticles in the vaccines??
0	Any group that drags its feet on cancer treatments but pushes through the covid vax can t be trusted.
0	Weighing interests against each other: personal freedom to decide for oneself about vaccination against the necessary protection for risk groups through a high vaccination rate.
1	Paediatric Multisystemic Inflammatory Syndrome (PMIS) is a disease that affects 1 in 4000 children, after being infected with #COVID19. Vaccination of children is recommended to prevent it
1	I’m going to say that vaccines are not an infringement on your liberty, they just make sure you like a healthy life free of horrible diseases
1	Why isn’t everyone getting their vaccines?!
1	I'm happy to get a booster! This is a life or death fight people. 39,000 children and teens got covid last week.
1	"Giving facts to the ignorant is like giving medicine to the dead".
1	My little brother & his wife refused to get vaccinated. He passed away last month while in the ICU due to Covid while his wife also sick & in the ICU was holding his hand. Our hearts were shattered & will never be the same! Please, please get vaccinated!
0	Of course the vaccine boss comes out to say this, his job depends on it
0	I’m unvaccinated got COVID. Felt like the flu. Not hospitalized. Not on a ventilator. Just taking time off from work.
0	So what are they putting into their bodies is the question. 70 million of us knew there couldn't be a vaccine developed that fast
1	Glad you all are OK. My family and I are all vaccinated and 4 out of the 5 of us got this stupid variant. We are all fine though. Thank goodness. No major symptoms.
1	I don’t think a nurse should be able to practice when they don’t believe in medical safety and science.
1	Guess what, you're alive coz you're vaccinated
1	The unvaccinated belong in prison they are a danger to society. Lock em up!
1	Those anti vax nut cases at it again!
0	I'm more likely to die in a car accident than die of COVID. And I still drive every day..
1	There are tons of studies now showing the vaccine is safe, how come the skeptics don’t know that?
1	You can be what’s considered “fully” vaccinated; that doesn’t mean that a very small percentage won’t contract Covid and croak. However, 98-99% of unvaccinated are the ones dying of Covid.
1	Educate yourselves! Covid vaccines aren't the devil!
0	Doctors and politicians have lied so much about this vaccine not being a vaccine that they are no longer credible and the worst thing is that this will also have a negative impact on real vaccines and on trust in doctors.
0	Keep getting that fake shot sheeples.
1	It’s absolutely fine to ask questions about #CovidVaccine . It’s absolutely fine to be hesitant about it and seek out more information. But actively promoting & disseminating COVID vaccine misinformation is not fine. Misinformation can kill.
1	Higher % of unvaccinated people end up in hospitals which puts a strain on the healthcare system which then lends itself to lockdowns and other restrictions.
1	Today is the day! My 72 year old dad finally gets his first vaccine.
0	I think "medical treatment" (vaccines) should be a matter of choice, right now you are forcing it
1	"Natural immunity" is a propaganda term to make doing nothing sounds like a good choice(it's not). Immune systems fail and you die, that's natural immunity. People with main character syndrome are the only ones who think they will be naturally immune from a new disease.
0	What's the long term effects from taking all these vaccines? Everybody seems to be rushing to get the most vaccine. Looks odd
1	Get vaccinated; it will make your life a lot easier, when you want to do things like travel to other countries that mandate that you get an approved Covid vaccine to skip the quarantine restrictions. Its that or wait until all the restrictions are gone and that could be awhile yet.
0	If I'm a front-line health worker, I'll accept partial immunity. Safety is the most important thing.
0	Didn’t japan find metals in all their moderna doses and have to recall/ban US vaccines from their country afterwards?
1	The definition of insanity is refusing a FREE vaccine which can protect you for no good reason
1	I hope everyone just freakin gets vaccinated! Come on people!
0	No vaxxers are the tin heads of the the 21st century, they are even worse than flat earthers
0	Vaccination is not a religion! You've bee brainwashed by all these medias! Scientist from all around the world are alarming about long term side effects of mrna vaccines. These vaccines interact negatively with the p53 gene which has a role in the fight against cancer.
1	when i got the covid vaccine, yeah, i was terrified, im absolutely terrified of getting vaccinated, not because its a bad thing, but because i have an irrational fear of needles, but still, id rather get vaccinated ten times in a row than to be sick with a deadly virus, id literally rather have to be vaccinated every day for the rest of my life if it meant id be completely healthy and have inmunity to deadly illnesses
0	Get your hands of our bodies! No jab is getting close to me!
0	We refuse Vaccine 👍👍
1	Just. Get. The. VACCINE.
0	The side effects are not documented
0	I'm healthy so I'll pass on the vaccine
0	It's all a lie Stupid, brainwashed idiots The vaccine does NOTHING
0	If you force someone into something that’s good for them then they’ll obviously question why you’re forcing them into it if it’s so beneficial anyways
0	Just a skosh of nausea in the middle of the night, achiness, and fatigue. Not bad at all.
0	Maybe people started to realize that vaccines aren’t near as necessary as big pharma makes them seam?
0	You will never put this drug into my child's body! I'll deal with covid, my family will deal with covid. You touch my child, you die. I'm not sorry. If I could sue you for a bad reaction, then I would start to re think my position
1	Did you know the pro's of getting the measles drastically out weighs the cons? Do your research people and STOP letting these people scare and control you.
1	We need to make vaccines mandatory
0	I'm all for tried, tested and proven vaccines, however the covid vaccination is none of these. Nor does it stop you from getting or spreading the virus.
0	All I am going to say is my grandma and my grand-grandma as well as my grandpa all died well OVER 90 and in peace, solely by trusting God and not seeing doctors for most of their life.
0	I hope I get COVID so I can prove to people that I've had bouts of food poisoning that are more serious and life threatening than a hyped up virus. Have you ever eaten bad fajitas? That will kill you faster than COVID.
1	The vaccines are safer versions of covid so that our immune systems can respond. and therfore you should take it
0	Sadly 70% of the population has taken the (((jab))). Besides beating these fucks we must also find ways to reverse the compounds contained in the jab.
0	Any parent that gives this poison to their children all I can say is God have mercy on your soul.
1	Those who choose not to take the vaccine should go to the end of queue when waiting to be admitted to hospitial
0	The extremely safe vaccine that Belgium said is giving young males heart inflammation? That vaccine?
1	Cruises now requiring vaccines. Get used to it. Soon it will be airlines, hotels, resorts, theatres, concerts, restaurants. Stay home if you like, instead of being a "sheeple". I am vaccinated and traveling and living life!
0	If I go into hospital I going to ask for unvaccinated doctor   See how that fairs
0	I think most have come to the realization that the vaccines don't work
0	I don't mask and I didn't vaccinate and now after 2 years I have the Coof. I have had worse flu seasons. Don't be cowards! This isn't the Black Death. I have 99.98% to survive this pathetic bug and so do most of you.
0	if you are severely allergic to any of the coronavirus vaccines’ ingredients, you should not be vaccinated.
1	I would say the main reason would be the inadequacy of the vaccination process. Not nearly enough people are vaccinated to gain much benefit
0	Not anti vax but I am anti this vaccine (it's not a vaccine but an experimental mRNA). Natural immunity is the way forward - I've had it and what should be carried out, are antibody tests on all prior to anyone 'choosing' to have this jab
1	Dec 2021 I would like to congratulate the doctors and scientists who brought us the covid vaccine about a year after the first covid cases were detected, this is incredible. It’s a miracle. For decades they haven’t been able to figure out cancer, aids, heart disease, strokes, etc etc etc....But the covid guys figure it out in less than a year, WOW, we need to get these people working on cancer research. I will be the first in line for the cancer vaccine.
0	My dad just got over having COVID and he has been fully vaccinated for half a year
0	So what's next? Does your neighbour have to be vaxxed also for you to receive treatment? Where are the trails against all these these traitors? Why aren't rope factories doing overtime making rope to help them along ...
0	To parents do you know the vaccine is 100x more dangerous to children than covid? Do you know that if your child suffers an adverse reaction or worse your story will be buried by the media.
0	I thought if people get the vaccine they can’t get COVID? So why is the video saying people who don’t get the vaccine are gonna get them sick? Aren’t you immune now since u got the shot???
0	Love how they say ‘it’s rare’ when so many are showing up with side effects and even death prove it’s not so rare.
1	ALSOOOO got my booster jab today!! that’s my third vaccine and going strong"
1	Well is the Corona 19 virus safe, this time last year were you wishing there was a vaccine,well there is my mother is 96 in a retirement home she got both I asked her how it was she said a piece of cake son! My wife got both she is fine, my point is don't be afraid it is fine!
0	A global medical dictatorship is underway and the Needle Nazis are loving it.
0	Stay safe. Stay away from anyone pushing the jab!
0	More power to the nurse, we all stand with you, no to the vaccine that was made in a hurry for political reasons!
0	Pretty sure that defective vaccines are how most zombie movies start. :-/
1	I work in a hospital and know half a dozen people who either outright refuse or don't get the second shot.
0	MUST WATCH! AND SHARE! Help save lives. Bill gates vaccine is genocide. STAND UP AND SAY NO!
0	the vaccine has not been tested long enough, moreover, not all side effects and after-effects are known yet.
1	I took the vaccine and as soon as I got home I got stuck in the dryer, luckily my step bro came home a few mins later after receiving his vaccine. I guess it worked!
1	The vaccine reduces transmission
0	and there are studies and actual human experiences where vaccinated kids were sicker than unvaccinated kids … some experiments were conducted within the same family to record over years the sickness and time it takes to recover.
1	I booked my two vaccinations today. I am so glad to be able to be vaccinated.
1	Thank you, doctor, for taking the time to give us the facts and even share your personal experience with the vaccine. I didn't know that there are more side effects from bp meds than the covid vaccine!   It's because of this video that my husband and I have scheduled our first dose of Pfizer.
0	Fortunately, you are already 81 years old, and you won't be able to spout your snot for much longer. Actually, vaccination in your case is a waste of money.
0	The COVID vaccines were failed day 1 because 1) Mortal antigenic sin's (original antigen sin) sub-optimal prejudiced initial prime & 2) no immunological stimulation of the mucosal barrier/lining
1	you wrong I am a kidney transplant patient with no immunity. The vaccine didn’t gave me any antibody. So I am in danger. If I catch it I wound not survive.
0	Just this video alone makes my blood boil! Imagine what a vaccine will do 😆
1	Gratefully hear Covid-19 Vaccine being apply
0	Same thing with my brother after the vaccine he got bump over his body and died after 4 days
1	Vaccines don't reduce the chance to spread the virus. Vaccinated people can spread the virus as well. Most people in hospitals with a positive PCR test turns out to be fully vaccinated people. Fact check it yourself.
1	so basically, if a bridge was 96.80%, you would prefer to swim with the 3.20%
0	This is disgusting and criminal and needs to be stopped.
0	Yeah, I'm still not getting it.
1	My mum refused vaccine.. shes currently in ICU having got severe covid..her heart stopped in the hospital..im actually glad im vaccinated because seeing her struggle so breathe and be so confused and unable to speak...it will haunt me
1	I love how people will do steroids , heroine, drugs, drink alcohol and eat junk food but won’t get the vaccine
0	I have concerns about how quickly the vaccine was developed and the lack of long term testing.  I have serious concerns about the vaccine permanently altering my own natural immunity in a way that will weaken it.  I have concerns that because of that I will be left vulnerable to not only new Covid strains....but any other viruses as well.  I feel there are more effective and safe ways of boosting my natural immunity, than to take a very questionable unproven vaccine.
1	This is beautiful and inspiring. Shoutout to the doctors and staff that made the vaccine possible. I just got my first dose of the vaccine. Stay safe!
0	My grandma was a RN for over 50 years. When this antivaxxer craze started over the flu vaccine about 20 years ago, she flat out said that anyone in healthcare who refuses to get ANY kind of vaccine should find another line of work.
1	coming here after gettong my first covid vaccine  whoever who still hasnt yet to get any vacine and are scared i just wanna say something :it dont really hurt
1	Protect yourself and get vaccinated
0	SAFE VACCINES DON'T EXIST.
0	I hear first hand from a medic , the vaccine destroys your immune system
0	I had the covid , no problem , two weeks of flu symptoms and then ok , would I take a vaccine for the covid ? No chance ,.
0	This is why I don’t try new medicines until they’ve been out for a while. Learned this from working as a veterinary technician. My first boss was the person who opened my eyes to how the FDA “highlights” certain studies and “buries” others. She taught me to use OBSERVATION as my tool. When you can’t tell the truth from lies, use your own eyes
0	I have never signed up for any experimental treatment and don't plan to start because of a 0.whatever mortality rate.
1	I can’t wait to get my 27th booster tomorrow. It’s been a week since my last, I haven’t felt like I’ve been in a safe space the past few days.
1	God why not just get it!
0	Surprise!!!! All the GOP millionaires have been vaccinated. They want to LIVE to spend. They are just duping their sheep for political ends.
0	Vaccines wont help, entrusting our lives to Jesus can. I am not worried about the virus.
0	It’s my god given right not to get the vaccine. SO GET THE FUCK OVER IT . By the way my husband got covid from someone that had been vaccinated.
0	Call me old fashioned, but how can you create a vaccine for something that doesn't yet exist?
1	Vaccinated people are far less likely to spread covid
0	I took a vaccine, was perfectly healthy before. Now I've had a chest pain especially when laying down for about a month. I'm done with this shit. I just hope I didn't get permanently fucked up.
1	Anyone who is dumb enough to refuse the vaccine is allowing Darwinism to run it’s course
0	Naturally acquired immunity is more protective than vaccine-induced immunity. Why bother with the vaccine?
0	Why can't everyone just get along and be a lifetime pincushion for Pfizer
0	I’d rather die (from Covid) as a free person than be forced to do anything. This is America, land of the free. Where has that freedom gone?
1	Get the shot
1	When I get on a plane I want a qualified pilot. When I go the dentist I want a qualified dentist. When I get my boiler serviced I want a qualified gas engineer …. When I want to protect myself and loved ones against a virus I don’t however want thousands of qualified viral epidemiologists with decades of experience all saying the same thing and backed by qualified medical experts in other field all over the world. Instead I want a bunch of unqualified fed up people without even the basics in school level biology to tell me how complicated science they don’t understand is in reality a hoax. .. yep, that makes sense
0	The more they push, the more I think 'what the hell is in this shit?' I'll pass on the clot shot.
1	Thank you doctor, you are the reason i took the vaccine. These kinds of videos help me make the choice to get vaxxed thank you!
1	I just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far. Thank you to all the scientists and researchers around the world for making the vaccine available this early and thank you for this channel for spreading the science. Yes, it’s definitely OK to be smart. Science rules!!!!
0	This all seems quite logical and follows what you'd expect based on established science. Any policy that doesn't consider natural immunity is effectively anti-scientific. Based on available data, I also don't see an argument for giving people with natural immunity any vaccine at all, as it would not offer statistically relevant protection. What we now need are studies on the longevity of natural immunity. Thanks Dr. John.
0	If the are hesitating to get the vaccine, they should not be forced. I don’t trust one minute all this comedy that the world is playing.
0	I am so happy to read the comments because I didn't see one that was in favour of this poison.
1	Good job! If you save your self by getting vaccinated that means you save the whole people's surrounding.
0	No covid 19 vaccines its not safe its not protecting its killing people. Only GOD can protect us nothing else
1	I got both shots one and two this past month and I only had slight body pain for a few hours
1	No, the vaccin cannot spread the virus. The injected mRNA only encodes for the spike protein and not for all the proteïnes and the RNA that is needed to make a new virus.
0	What about protection from naturral immunity? Most people who aren't vaxed have had the virus and have more protection that the vaccinated. Honestly ... Does anyone read?
1	Boosters save lives. PERIOD. Get your boosters. And get your kids vaccinated.
0	Most profitable business at the moment. Vaccines. Don't take them
1	I need this translated in spanish, wish I could confidently explain like the guys in the videos why it is important to be vaccinated, but I'm not and people in latin america are too superstitious when accepting something that will help them but they do not understand. Well that last part maybe its a global issue
0	How about don’t vaccinate people who aren't in risk groups.
0	No. I don't want a vax adverse effect. I don't want a rare disorder. That's not in the interest of my safety, or best interests.
1	Dear unvaccinated If you have a reaction it is a GOOD THING that is your immune system learning to fight the real infection!
0	I'm just glad I never got caught up in politics enough to ever get suckered into taking the vaccine
0	I heard that a lot of women who have gotten the shot/shots are experiencing issues with their cycle or lack there off. Smh.
1	Force those unvaxxed to wear their unvaxxed stars.
0	If theirs no harm in vaccination why do you have to sign a waiver so if you had a bad reaction the government is not responsible
0	You would not want to vaccinate your kids because all vaccines are full of toxins and poisons.
1	I never want to see anybody get or suffers from Covid but when it hits a Covid denier or someone who is heavily anti vaccine I don’t feel bad for them
0	These companies have no interest in your health. There is no money in well people....
0	How do we do this without knowing the long term effects of vaccine on children? This is truly madness.
0	The vaccine made me get constant dizziness for 7 months straight still going on
0	No! No long term studies! Also, not like other vaccines at all, brand new technology! So many adverse affects and reports of death after vaccination. Long term prospects look even worse.
0	We don't know what the long term side effects are
0	How dare they continue to claim that vaccines reduce risk to others? Claiming this is committing fraud
1	Getting a COVID-19 vaccine can help protect children ages 5 years and older from getting COVID-19.
0	Funny how if a vaccinated person dies, the people who aren't vaccinated gets the blame
0	No Because it is a brand new vaccine, and needs at least 4-10 years to prove it is safe.  This one has been rushed out too soon, period end of story.
1	It is being developed and tested by reputable companies with scientist researchers who know what they are doing. It was tested on 40,000 people of various ages. Press releases report 90 percent or higher efficiency.  Edit: now in mid 2021 we have millions vaccinated with very rare side effects of concern. Way safer than getting COVID
1	YES. PLEASE get the vaccine when your age group is eligible. I’m 17 and my mom doesn’t want me getting it but I am making it a goal to get vaccinated ASAP. My first flu shot was only a year ago because she was skeptic and I am perfectly healthy right now. Please stay safe everyone!
1	Exciting news ! I got boosted today! SyringeRaising handsClapping hands signMicrobe. It was a super quick and easy.
1	I have taken all vaccine dose including boostor dose too so I'm feeling much more safe but i always stay safe and follow the covid protocol, thank you
0	They used taxpayers money to buy the vaccine and they also use the taxpayers money to dispose the waste...
0	Having 100% population vaccinated doesn't end shit. Stop with this blabbering nonsense. If vaccines actually work, there's no need to keep masks, mandates, and other useless stuff. Also, if one is vaccinated and still get infected and spread, then vaccines are not effective!
1	A huge thank you to everyone involved in the COVID vaccination programme. Dose 1 of 2. Ensuring the safety of everyâ€
0	Yes! this will protect my families Gene's for the rest of their lives! (By manipulating and allowing them to be infertile) hooooray for modern RNA manipulation with technology.
1	People will eat fast food but getting a vaccine is where they cross the line. You don’t cry about what’s in your food but you wanna cry about a shot. And this is coming from someone who doesn’t have the vaccine, and the only reason is that I don’t need it because I have natural antibodies.
1	God bless the many researchers and scientists throughout history that have made this feat possible. Thank you TED for providing clarity on the Covid vaccine.
1	If covid doesn’t scare you then dying alone in a hospital without being able to see family or friends as you pass should. The only person there will be a nurse who’s tired going off a 16 hour shift and you’re just another statistic. That trip to the hospital could be the last time you see the outdoors and you don’t even see it coming
0	No vax for me I will take my chances with nature
0	Imagine if they promoted healthy diet and lifestyles like they have the vaccine
1	I'm grateful for vaccines, over the decades, that have saved so many lives. Thank you, Science
0	But now they want folks to get a new toxic jab ever 8 months. No thank you.
0	Don’t censor yourself. The media is lying about COvId. You should have RFk Jr on your podcast
0	Yes let's let big business get even more into our medical history than they already are
0	The American Government has no business whatsoever telling the citizens of America what to do with our bodies.
0	Or just do nothing like me, and be fine as well.
1	Great video Dr.Mike! I’m getting vaccinated asap. Thank you for clearing all the misinformation.
0	Pfizer in the lab cooking up a new variant to be shipped out and “discovered “ in some random place which will then instantly arrive in the United States
1	Vaccines help make covid less severe. Just like chicken pox, rubella, pneumonia, All those vaccines help your body build the protection, so you stay out of the hospital. They never said people wouldn’t get it,,,just wouldn’t get it as badly.
0	I am a very healthy person, I had never been hospitalized and I was hesitant to get the vaccine but I travel a lot. I got the vaccine and I got horrible side effects. I am out of breath every time I workout.
0	Vaccine remorse is real
0	the last time I was vaccinated it put me into a two day coma. So I’m done with vaccines. Especially EXPERIMENTAL ones.
0	I just got over COVID without taking a vaccine
0	COVID Vaccines Causing Miscarriages, Cancer and Neurological Disorders Among Military, DOD Data Show
0	My kids ain't taking that sh*t...and if you ain't down with that, I've got two words for yaaaaaa...........
1	I’m pro vax and am vaccinated but I had Covid before being vaxxed and it was nothing compared to getting it after being vaxxed lol
1	What kind of country are we becoming? He should not be denied anything!
1	You need at least 70% of people to take the vaccine to get rid of it so just giving it to elderly and people with pre existings isn’t enough, as someone with health conditions I really hope people won’t be selfish and take it so people like me and the elderly can go back to normal lives
0	The AstraZeneca shot killed my relative; he died from multiple blood clots.
1	I’m pro vaccines but I’m against mandates. If people want to jump off the bridge just don’t take me with you I’m fine.
0	If the COVID vaccines were so safe and effective, why doesn't the FDA take them out of Emergency Use Authorization and approve them outright?  One difference between EUA and outright approval is that under EUA, vaccine makers can't be sued for adverse effects.  The most financially lucrative move for Pfizer and Moderna would be to lobby governments to impose vaccine mandates and sell large quantities of vaccines without liability.
0	Ask yourself: Will you develop CANCER quicker or not, by taking a vaccine booster shot (chemicals) every 6 months for the rest of your life? 💉🦀💉🦀💉🦀💉
1	TAKE THE SHOT
1	I'm taking this covid shit serious I wear a mask everywhere I go even though I got both my covid shots and my booster not taking NO CHANCES
0	This vaccination has been the most barberous pratice and one of the most fatal.
1	I’m 64, and had my vaccines (“Better safe than sorry”). My 75-year-old husband refuses to get his. I guess he wants out of this marriage, and wants to leave me widowed a second time.
0	Why could we not have used a traditional vaccine instead? mRNA is such a money grab
1	I don’t want to go to a Dr that doesn’t have vaxxed staff.
0	My 2 cents. Build your immune system naturally. 1 Zinc and Quercetin 2 Vitamin C and sunshine and Vitamin D daily. Just common sense.
1	The vaccine reduces symptoms so you should take it.
1	Yes, I am getting vaccinated now, but only because the self-tests are no longer accepted or can no longer be carried out at all, which really annoys me.
0	I'm more immune now that I've had covid than I was with the vaccine.
0	VACCINATION is NOT the same as IMMUNIZATION! I don't want to take vaccine
1	If only there had been something we could have done to stay alive… oh wait, THERE IS. It is called VACCINE.
0	He is not the only Doctor speaking out plenty off non vaccine doctors across the world are saying No also. Good
0	I do not believe in conspiracy theories, but after all these pressure with vaccinations you can't help but wonder what lies behind.
0	I would more likely stay safe by keeping up my personal hygiene, sleeping good and eating well, and do some sports. And use herbal ways to heal my body from covid, not vaccine
0	No, kids shouldn't get viccinate, is too soon to know future health concequence
1	everyone needs to learn how to conform and comply to what the government is telling you to do so the world will be a safer place. if they say get another shot , just get the dang shot and be happy . yes i know i spent the last 4 years completely against the government and everything they did or said , but now that agent orange is gone we need to conform and comply with the government . period
0	Natural immunity is the only real kind of immunity. All other forms of induced immunity, are artificial attempts to cheat nature. Personally, I opted out of participating in these experiments back in January 2020, and I won't be changing my mind.
0	They are starting to have articles published to prepare people for the sickness the vaccine will cause to most people. I have no intention of getting a vaccine that hasn't had years of studies.
1	I had my second shot of pfizer 3 weeks ago. I felt rough for about a week, I have also seen the horror stories surrounding these vaccines. Thank you so much for this video brilliantly explained and reassuring.
1	Don't feel like you have to follow the anti-vaxxers. They don't know you. They are not worth trusting. Value yourself and get a vaccine.
1	They’re safe and effective! This list also is only a handful of the most dangerous diseases we have been able to tame or overcome.
1	USA ages 0-19: 771 883 Covid Deaths. 0 Vaccine Deaths. Mmmk
0	My mother had her second jab and her shoulder is in constant pain now, the medical professionals have been very good with her and have said it was a wrongly administered covid shot that has caused her shoulder muscles issues.
1	This vaccine Actually sounds brilliant! I pray to God we can make it another year or two..
0	That's it I am not having the booster, in fact I'm not having the second jab either, because I never had the first. Nay, nay and thrice nay.
1	Vaccines prevent millions of deaths from both Covid and lockdowns. Because we have vulnerable in society, collectively we must do everything we can to protect them. People never cried freedom on Hepatitis B, Tetanus, etc. Social media drivel influences a gullible fringe minority.
1	God Bless the doctors, nurses and staff, I pray for the patients and their families people if gotten vaccinated please go get vaccinated
0	We must stand up and not take the vaccine!! Period!
1	Just get vaccinated for heaven’s sake!!!!
0	accinated people can still get infected and believes there’s a lack of clarity about the shots’ long-term safety
1	Don’t deny covid asshole.
0	I purchase and decide what I will use or put in my body so no one should try to persuade anyone to put something in there bodies that cannot be taken away.
0	If there was any doubt in people's minds surely this must wake people up to the evil behind this scam
0	Nah I’m good. I have antibodies don’t need it
1	And we have selfish people here in the US that refuse to be vaccinated.
0	Im a simple man. MY CRITICAL FREE THINKING MIND AND MY IMMUNE SYSTEM ARE MY PROTECTION. A highly potent combination.
0	Better them than me. Who doesn't want a politicized and rushed vaccine injected into them?
1	It’s not the spread that’s the main concern. It’s the chances of serious illness, hospitalization, ICU need and death. All those are massively reduced with the vaccine especially with a booster. Best for your own health and your loved ones. Best to stop straining health systems.
0	The CEO's who made the vaccine won't even take it, that is why we should not take the shot
0	These vaccines kill.
1	I got both doses last year. For the first shot, my arm was just sore for a day. The second dose was a little bit unpleasant. Had a slight fever and runny nose for a day, but after that I was alright again. Till now I haven’t gotten sick, so that’s good! Stay safe everyone!
1	If I could I would take 3
1	We got a safe vaccine that gives good protection against severe disease and death
1	Can’t wait to see the needle for caronavirus  in Australia
1	I got my second dose of Moderna yesterday morning and I feel like I've been hit by a bus. My whole body is aching and I have the chills. The first shot didn't affect me at all. UPDATE: I'm still alive lol I feel perfectly fine now, the body aches lasted for only a day
1	Wow this is so informative. I was hesitant to get my vaccine but I think I will do it now
0	Concerning is the protection these vaccine manufactures have. Cannot be sued or held liable if things go terribly wrong. Why so untouchable?
0	Democrats claim to "follow the science " except when it comes to natural immunity.
0	Im not hesitant im firmly not taking it. I love how ppl use words like hesitant to influence thought
1	The vaccines haven’t changed but the virus has. It’s mutated to become better at infecting vaccinated people. The vaccines and booster are still very good at preventing serious illness, hospitalization and deaths.
1	My parents are conservatives, but I'm so glad they actually took Covid seriously and got vaccines as soon as they possibly could, despite the constant barrage of misinformation from Fox News and other conservative media.
1	Dr. Anthony Fauci cited these findings during a Jan. 21 press briefing, noting they likely help explain why most ppl who have received a #COVID19Vaccine & booster are protected from severe disease & hospitalization, no matter which variant infects them.
1	THE COVID19 VACCINE IS IMPORTANT FOR ANY BODY.
1	Absurd. Only people who aren’t vaccinated are getting hospitalized. Quit punishing the smart ones.
1	When u realize that the kid that bullies you is anti vax so u sneeze in his lunchbox
0	"People don't have trust in Government." "Let's show how trusting we can be by censoring and cancelling people whom we disapprove."
0	Both my parents got the two vaccine and still they were infected with covid , and I got infected by them , I didn't get the vaccine because of heart issues and the fact that my body is very sensitive to all these man made biochemical especially since last year July I was floxed by cipro and almost lost my life.
0	The vaccine doesn't stop people from getting the virus, or spreading it, lol.
1	I’m getting mine as soon as it’s available for me! My grandmother for her first phizer vaccine today and is doing very well so far.
0	Don’t do it people!! Dang it!!! I hate people are going for this crap!!!
0	“Your natural antibodies are better than the vaccine”- Pfizer scientist caught on hidden camera
1	The lack of empathy by the vax hesitant for the people who have suffered from the virus and the frontline workers who risked their lives to save people is so frustrating.
1	I'm also vaccinated because I don't want to get really sick or die
1	I contracted Covid in December, before vaccines were available. I was first in line when I was eligible, for my first shot and then my second. Believe me, not being able to breathe was my motive!
0	Lmao.. Look how hard they trying to sell it... Remember all those flu shots on live tv.. Me either.. Remember when they cured the flu.. Me eithe
0	Iris Figuora: I listed all the ingredients of the vaccine and contacted the Poisons Department. After intros and the like, and asking to speak to someone knowledgeable, this is the gist of that conversation. Me: My question to you is how are these ingredients categorized? As benign or as poison? (I checked a few ingredients, formaldehyde, Tween 80, mercury, aluminum, phenoxyethanol, potassium phosphate, sodium phosphate, sorbitol, etc.) He: Well, that's quite a list ... But it's easy to say that they are all poisonous to humans ... Used in fertilizers ... Pesticides ... To stop the heart ... To kill a dead body preserve ... They are registered with us in different categories, but quite a lot of poisons. Why? Me: If I intentionally fed or injected my child with these ingredients, often, as a schedule, of course I would put my daughter in danger ... But what would happen to me legally? He: Strange question ... But you would probably be charged with criminal negligence ... maybe with the intent to kill ... and of course child abuse ... Your child would be taken from you ... Do you know anyone does his child? This is criminal ... An industry ... These are the ingredients used in vaccines ... With binders to keep the body from leaching them ... To keep antibody levels high indefinitely ... He: WHAT ?! Your conclusion? The man was beside himself. He asked if I wanted to email him all this information. He wanted to share it with his grown children who are parents. He was appalled and hated that he didn't know ... his kids are vaccinated and they have health problems ... " ~ By Iris Figueroa ️ INGREDIENTS OF VACCINES - YOU CANNOT make an informed decision without being educated. Here are just a few vaccine ingredients. These will be INJECTED in your children; ️Formaldehyde / Formalin - Highly toxic systemic poison and carcinogen. ️Betapropiolactone - Toxic chemical and carcinogen. Can cause death / permanent injury after very brief exposure to small amounts. Corrosive chemical. ️Hexadecyltrimethylammonium Bromide - May cause damage to liver, cardiovascular and central nervous systems. May cause reproductive effects and birth defects. ️Aluminium Hydroxide, Aluminum Phosphate and Aluminum Salts - Neurotoxin. Poses a risk of long-term inflammation of the brain / swelling, neurological disorders, autoimmune disease, Alzheimer's, dementia and autism. It invades the brain where it persists indefinitely. ️Thimerosal (mercury) - Neurotoxin. Causes cell damage, decreases oxidation-reduction activity, cell degeneration and cell death. Associated with neurological disorders, Alzheimer's, dementia, and autism. ️Polysorbate 80 & 20 - Crosses the blood brain barrier and carries aluminum, thimerosal and viruses; allowing it to enter the brain. ️Glutaraldehyde - Toxic chemical used as a disinfectant for heat-sensitive medical equipment. ️Fetal Bovine Serum - Harvested from bovine fetuses (cows) taken from pregnant cows prior to slaughter. ️Human Diploid Fibroblast Cells - aborted fetal cells. Foreign DNA has the ability to interact with our own DNA. ️African Green Monkey Kidney Cells - Can carry the SV-40 cancer-causing virus that has already infected about 30 million Americans. ️Acetone - Can cause kidney, liver and nerve damage. ️E.Coli - Yes you read that right. ️DNA of the porcine circovirus type-1 ️Human embryonic lung cell cultures (from aborted fetuses
1	You know what also causes myocarditis? Covid, and it's worse with real covid than the vaccine. Given that Omicron is so incredibly transmissible, everyone is going to get it. Odds are STILL better with the vaccine. Seriously.
0	The boosters increases the spike protein production and also reduce the effectiveness of the immune system to fight any viruses!
1	Thank you Dr Mike! I'm scheduled for my first vaccine 5/14 second 6/4. Hubby got both of his. Only 24 hours of flu like symptoms and he's fine now
0	This whole thing sounds sick and disturbing, you're basically forcing people to take an experimental drug and no one is liable for any damages that this experimental drug causes... Is any of this sound right to anyone?
0	73 years old never had a flu shot in my life my resistance to the coronavirus is that of a twenty-year-old
0	I am a 68 year old man who I think has fought off both main COVID variants without the vaccine or medical care. It seems to me that I am better off having a successful natural response to the disease than artificial one.
1	I literally cried when I got my vaccine from utter happiness.
0	Let's think for a moment, should I be a sheep and take the death shot,  ok now that I have thought about it NO
1	If I could get the first vaccines I would. I caught the virus, and spent 9 days in the hospital.
1	i'm still amazed by the raging dumpster fire that is the youtube comment section. yeah, i know there's a 99.999999999% chance it's a waste of time, but i have a morbid curiosity. example, a recent video "Fauci baffled by latest COVID vaccine data" (he was baffled barely half of the vaccinated got booster shots) had everything from "why does anyone take him or the cdc seriously anymore", "liar", "he created covid in a lab in wuhan", to "pharma shill". thousands of comments spewing a regurgitation of one of those themes each thinking they're being witty or insightful. it's like a "worst of" version of humanity. i'm tempted to make an account only commenting about how great fauci is and how you can trust the science just to see how long it lasts before it's downvoted into oblivion and banned.
1	As someone who has still not had their sense of smell 100% return since having covid, these anti vax people anger me. Thats something that I now have to deal with for the rest of my life.
0	Long covid, code for lets keep the vaccine gravy train rolling.
0	why didn't you bring up that vaccines have to have a way longer testing trail periods and a far grander pool of participants to determine if they are save, than we had even until now? Or that governments gave exemptions to pharmaceutical companies to shield them from liability?
1	I was thinking about all of the orgies that folks have participated in and didn’t catch a disease. The put their lives at risk because of lust.  How many times folks have taken drugs. Shared needles for a habit and are alive.  When you take cancer drugs it’s poison but the doctor let’s know it’s your only hope.  But when they’re asked to take a vaccine for a planetary plague they lose their shyt!
1	Vaaaaccccciiiiinnnnne, paaaarty!!!!!!!!
1	My 99 year old mother has received both shots and it has been two weeks since the second vaccination. She’s doing very well.️️🇨🇦🇨🇦
0	Taking the vaccine in exchange for the hope on an easier progression of the illness is like cutting off your leg to avoid the athletes foot
0	I heard that these vaccines are not so efficient against the south african variant. Will we ever reach here immunity if the virus keeps mutating?
1	I have no problem with vaccine where can I get 2 doses asap want to get back to living
1	Thank you for creating this video. It's very frustrating to read all the anti vaccine comments all over the internet. Even here in Switzerland, where we supposedly have very good general education there's an alarming rise of people spreading misinformation.
1	I’m getting mine as soon as it’s available for me! My grandmother for her first phizer vaccine today and is doing very well so far.
1	"does no one else think this is a bad idea?" No, this is a great idea. This is the biggest medical breakthrough since the invention of vaccines themselves.
0	I did not get those vaccines. Lol sorry. Wtf do you know about the outcomes? Nothing. Do you know how bad our education system is? My wife and I are highly educated and our kids will be too. Here’s a tip… never assume.'
1	75% is still better than a 0%. Get the vaccine!
1	People should've gotten vaccinated.  They went out protesting.
1	It took only 15 mints to get my Puhpoo vaccinated in CDA medical centre G9 #good arrangements #CovidVaccine #GetVaccinated
0	yes actually 60 days is enough... any and all side effects happen within 1 to 3 days... it's a dose of salts and a protien... it's not asbestos or round up... but do remain in fear, and ignore the actual threat...
1	Okay!..I’ll take a chance and get the jab
0	It was them being caught in a lie. This was the case since the beginning. Vaccinated people still died from covid even when the vaccines were first distributed for "alpha" variant.
1	My mom says that the covid 19 will end if WE ALL GET VACCINATED.
0	I still can't believe how so many people refuse to acknowledge all the lies and inflated numbers that were used to sway public opinion through fear. It's like they've moved on to believing the next lie and don't have time to acknowledge the truth about being bamboozled time and time again in the recent past.
1	Not OP, but I told my grandparents that I'd rather them hate me forever and never talk to me again but be vaccinated, because I love them and want them to be alive a long time even if it means they live their lives without me. I'd rather know they were safe and alive even if it meant they never wanted to see me again. I meant it. It worked.
0	Children are definitely not in emergency need of vax.
1	oh god the anti-vaxxers in the comments
1	I am one of >300 scientists who signed this calling for global vaccine equity.  In addition to the certainty of new variants emerging, there's also the disgrace of people, including health care workers, dying of COVID-19 because of lack of vaccine access
0	This is FAR below the standard of investigative journalism I expected from the Guardian. Simple fact: When there are millions if not billions of dollars to be made from a product the manufacturers and marketeers of said product need to be scrutinised for the claims they are making regarding efficacy and safety. When a company or industry is fabulously wealthy we should assume - if we are to learn anything from history - that they will be massaging the statistics in their favour. and spending a lot of money to suppress negative press. I'm old enough to remember when medical doctors were recommending people take up smoking to "calm the nerves" and you couldn't walk a hundred yards or watch a sporting event without being inundated with tobacco advertising. Really that wasn't that long ago, and it was the same 'science' that was manipulated for decades until the evidence eventually stacked up to be irrefutable - but only after millions had died. Second simple fact: if a product is 99.9% safe but is sold/supplied/given to tens if not hundreds of millions of people then it's reasonable to expect the 0.1% to be a very angry, very vocal minority that, given the numbers involved, adds up to a considerable number of people across the world. If you then factor in that the vaccine regimen for children in some states of the USA is totally driven by Big Pharma and VERY different to the relatively sane and mostly scientifically driven regimens applied in the UK and Europe, you realise that the odds of your child being in the 0.1% is a very worrying probability. Now I've just used an arbitrary 0.1% to make my point. In reality vaccines are all very different and have hugely differing rates of vaccinosis depending on age and pre-existing health conditions, but the third simple fact is that anyone insisting that all vaccines are universally 100% safe is talking politics NOT science. That all said you should really ignore my concerns because I was part of the loony fringe that thought that politicians might just maybe be getting a few too many back handers from the tobacco companies . . .
1	If you’re one of those truckers in Canada that caused a state of emergency over a vaccine.. get fucked. Oh, and get vaccinated.
0	The shot will not prevent you from getting COVID, my daughter's friend caught covid after receiving both injections, she never had covid before
1	I would take infinite amount of boosters if it will keep me away of lockdowns and spreading viruses
1	If every antivaxxer on the planet died nothing of value would be lost
1	(Talked to a certified medical professional in a University hospital)" 86% vaccinated here on PEI with a population of only 140,000 and no serious reactions to the vaccines yet.
0	Our neighbour got his second vaccine and ended up in hospital
1	Incredible time to be alive. Science makes life so much better, I really hope we'll also best other challenges like climate change.
0	I will definitely not be taking it myself and I applaud these nurses for exercising their constitutional rights as American citizens!
1	They do work it is igh time parents and also the community embraces the importance of ensuring their children are vaccinated so as to prevent them from future unnecessary illnesses
1	Got both my shots
1	It is sad to see how some people so quickly choose to believe uneducated conspiracy theorists on the internet over educated doctors and scientists.  One question:  When was the last time any conspiracy theorist has been correct about something???
1	lol what are you on about. Literally everyone around me has had the vaccine and there haven’t been any side effects apart from the illness it can cause when initially getting the jab. Maybe people would see the reality that most have taken it and most are fine if they actually went outside for once
1	Imagine making one of the most significant advancements in the history of medicine and some Karen with a google search thinks she’s smarter.
0	How many people (who've already recovered from the virus and have natural immunity) do you need to jab against their will to save one life? This is about life-saving, right? Not control?
1	Anti-vaccine disinformation has turned reasonable questions and concerns over rare side effects into conspiracy worries
1	Pfizer, Astrazeneca whatever! take the shot! protect yourself
1	There is some good news: The first doses of the #PfizerBioNTech vaccine arrived in California last night.
0	As an anti...I might get one in a few years..boo me
0	It's stupid to me. I have 3 family members who tested positive after getting vaccinated. So what difference does it make?
0	Vaccines are what is putting pressure on this virus to mutate. The science on this is settled. You are falling pray to government propaganda my friend.
0	Have doctors forgotten “First Do No Harm”. The way people who have vaccine reactions are being treated is nothing short of disgraceful
1	And people still believe the virus is fake...smh
1	MRNA vaccines are the best of the best! They will save lives and will increase the possibility of end this shitty pandemic
0	Had no real problems with vaccines until covid. With so much pressure being brought to bear for such a mild set of symptoms, it was pretty clear there were other not so nice reasons for the shots. Now,,, no shots for me....
0	When people with the 4th shot start blaming it on people with the 3rd shot. This is comical.
0	and why the vaccine will kill more people than the corona virus did !!!! process of elimination.. only the strong will survive..
0	My husband and I had COVID at the same time. I had it pretty bad but my husband had several morbidities and only had a small fever and headache one day. Neither of us had the vaccine. So the premise that you get a lighter case if your vaccinated did not apply in this case
0	When will people realize this is NOT about our health. It's about MONEY
0	It's because it's warming up and the warm weather kills the virus just like Trump said it would!
1	PUT THIS ON TV! The amount of people who don't understand how vaccines work is astounding.
1	Imagine being too lazy to get vaccinated
1	The vaccine was able to be developed so quickly bc scientists already understood the general family of the coronavirus. The Covid-19 isnt the same but close enough that the previous research allowed scientists a jumpstart and instead of having to map the Gene's, they could focus on a vaccine.
0	Any parent that would inject their kids with that poison should be held on neglect charges!
0	There is blood on the hands of so many people #VaccineSideEffects #VaccineDeaths #AustraliaHasFallen
0	Vaccine hesitant people may be critical thinkers which is a good thing.
1	don`t care what these antivaxxers have to say, I feel myself responsible to protect bith myself and others and therefore am vaccinated. I sincerely hope tht the antivaxxers out there remain healthy - hwoever should they get infected then they and their famlies should be made pay for their treatment
1	I'm ok with this, the more jabs the more the stock prices rise. Keep them going. :)
1	True! My brother 65 got Covid and he has AFIB and is a big drinker. He is recovering. Could have been so much worse! Vaxxed and boosted saved him.
1	Ten thousand covidiots didn't like this video. That's more vaccine available for the rest of us.
1	You can still have COVID when you are vaccinated, the vaccine just helps your immune system destroy the virus quicker and also makes it less likely that a person will die from COVID
1	My record debating anti vaxers in 100% victory. Their arguments make no sense and they know it.
1	How about the unvaccinated just get vaccinated and we can put this stupid pandemic behind us. We don't want it mutating beyond our ability to vaccinate.
1	My daughters best friend is just getting over a COVID infection. She was double vaccinated almost 6 months ago. Good thing because she was hit hard. Now her vaccinated 14 year old son is sick with it. Omicron is dangerous without the vaccines.
0	Politicians need to be held accountable for crimes against humanity.
1	Make the unvaccinated pay higher insurance premiums just like smokers have to.
1	COVID-19 vaccines are safe, effective, & the safest protection against severe illness.
1	what I meant is the non jabbed will get the virus, suffer from it and then rise the people in the intensive care units and whatever steps the country take, we the jabbed ones will suffer. Why not just get jabbed. What’s the big deal ?????
0	@Josh Wilson A subjective label to help you cope? I'm just telling as it is, from what I've personally experienced, and seen. The evidence is out there, so is the doubt. Personally I would never get this Vaccine, I don't need it. But if you genuinely believe that this Jab will help you... go for it bud, I wish you all the luck in the world. 😬
1	I HOPE COVID MUTANTS AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THE VACCINE SURVIVE AND THE DUMB IDIOTS WHO HAVENT DIE.
1	Hey fella speaking as a health care pro i would just like to say im all for vax just the RIGHT VAX with no added nasties that all
0	Prolly not cause I'm pretty sure I already have it and I'm either a carrier or immune
0	The reason why I’m not getting vaccine is because I’ve had family members get it and STILL get covid. Also it is literally a test to put on people. We are just experiment and I would rather not get something that I don’t know fully works which obviously it doesn’t.
1	Thanks for the information. After vaccination I had fever at night and flue like symptoms. 2nd day subsided after 3 doses if paracetamol tablets
1	Fully vaccinated Americans are 14 times less likely to die of COVID-19 than those who haven’t gotten the shots. Boosted Americans are 97 times less likely. Those were the figures presented Wednesday by Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on reports from 25 jurisdictions in the week ending Dec. 4. For every 100,000 people, 9.7 of those who were unvaccinated were killed by the coronavirus, compared to 0.7 of those fully vaccinated and 0.1 of the boosted.
1	This message is a call to mobilise for vaccination. Protect yourself.
1	We really dropped the ball in containing the virus but at least we're doing good on vaccinations.
1	Fox could have inspired these fools to do the right thing for the country. ...band together to beat this virus..instead they come up with lame BS about freedom and non science to fight getting vaccinated.
0	They want to use this to inject something to us
1	If I could get the first vaccines I would. I caught the virus, and spent 9 days in the hospital. Would be nice if you had a section here, talking about what goes wrong if the vaccine is not safe. Pretty sure these 2 vaccines will get approved by FDA.
0	no. in fact we arent far off not needing any shots, at all. pandemics do not go on forever, in business cycles. despite appearances to the contrary.
0	I'm not getting it. I'm not anti vax or anything. I'm young and healthy and my body always handles sickness very well. I want my body to learn to handle it on its own. I don't get flu shots for the same reason.
0	Stop lieing to us.  We are on to you. The pcr test is a hoax to get you vaccinated
1	Good for these companies for promoting vaccination
0	I graduated the D.A.R.E program in 1986. I wont bow to peer pressure. Just Say No
1	Sarah Palin: "I'll get the vaccine over my dead body." COVID-19: "Your terms are acceptable."
1	Same goes for the vax.
0	Can someone tell me if it's wrong to have so much hope on this?
0	It is quite interesting that the vaccination should develop its full protection after an infection has been experienced, because obviously the vaccination cannot prevent it.
1	its free safe and you protect urself ur family and other people
0	People should be cautious of both Covid and the vaccine on fertility. We have no long term study on either.
0	if we are still likely to get covid while vaccinated, then what’s the point?
1	Congrats on getting vaccinated!
1	Stab me please, I want to be shot! Give me the shot!
1	I just got 1st dose (Pfizer) because of being scared, confused and concerned about underlying issues conflicting with it and truthfully did feel slightly ill after and still fearful of side effects but at same time I felt it more important and safer to take the bet* of LIVING and being able to see and enjoy LIFE.
0	I'm gonna be nice to my body and stay unvaxxed and stay unboostered. That way, me myself and I will get along.
1	My anti vaxxer neighbor died yesterday…leaving behind a 13 year old son..she was one of those protesters here in my town asking for freedom..well now she has “ freedom” and her son lost her mother
0	Get vaccinated if you want to join the side of Satan and be evil!
1	just got my covid vaccine- astounded at the process, grateful for this moment.
1	I'm fully vaccinated and glad for the hard work and dedication in developing it.
0	Am not a skeptic, am not hesitant, not an anti vaxxer either. Am an intelligent free thinking, free breathing adult who has researched the dangers of an experimental dangerous UNNECESSARY drug and decided I dont want to die.
1	I took the Pfizer Vaccine which is great ??
0	I haven’t had any vaccines in 30+ years and my kids are totally vax FREE
1	Hopefully what comes out of this is a one time vaccine against all symptom producing viruses.
0	I'll be one of your challenges. I respectfully decline your offer of medical treatment. Thank you.
0	If your employer demands that you get vaccinated because it's "perfectly safe", you tell them to write up a document stating that if you suffer any effects that inhibit your ability to work, that they will be responsible for your medical and financial needs for the rest of your life. Let's see if they will agree to that!
1	It's not about freedom, it's simply respect for others. If you don't care about getting sick, that's fine, just don't put other people at risk.
0	I have an immune system that works pretty damn good. I will just eat right and skip all the experiments with the vaccine.
1	What I find funny is that if you show a scientist proof that he is wrong, he'll analyze it and change his mind. However proving antivaxx/homeopathy fans they're wrong simply reinforces their beliefs
1	It's as safe as any vaccine, ever. It's already proven, and is saving literally millions of lives.
1	Getting vaccinated and then natural infection seems best
1	I got a COVID-19 booster as soon as it was available where I live. This is because I am a responsible adult and do not want to get sick or get other people sick
0	The vaccine is covid, people are getting sick after they get the booster. If the vaccine is making people sick from the booster then they are not producing anti bodies to fight covid. The booster should not be getting people sick but it puts them out of work for 2 weeks.
1	When you think the average IQ is below 100 it's not a surprise that there are literally millions of idiots who will believe the anti-vaccine nonsense.
0	I'm soooooooo glad me and my family were smart enough not to get jabbed
1	Hopefully it will convince people who are worried about taking the vaccine to receive it.
0	I never expected people to sleep on ALL those harmful effects from the so-called vaccines like it's nothing. I am so disappointed…
0	2 shots did not work. Lets try another and another. That sounds like the definition of insanity.
0	Please take note that @pfizer, the same company that has NO LIABILITY towards adverse events from their #COVID19Vaccine, also paid out the LARGEST settlement of $2.3billion over its illegal marketing and off label promotion of #Bextra and other drugs.
0	If you believe getting the "covid" vaccine is smart then you're not paying attention.
1	95% of patients in London Intensive Care Units have not been fully vaccinated at least 40% of them will die, that's the point of getting vaccinated.
1	the virus wont be gone but it will unlikely spread widely due to vaccines.
1	Thanks once again, Lex, for all you do. I was sorry your guest didn’t make it clear that scientists have been working on mRNA vaccines for over 30 years. Please try to get Katalin Kariko or other of the pioneering mRNA scientists on your podcast.
0	It's awesome how youtube will only allow one side of this argument.
1	I'm proud to be vaccinated. I did it to protect others & myself.
1	Great about time We in Australia need more mRNA vaccines
1	I got my booster shot of biontech vaccine 2 days ago. I hope everyone follow health official recommendations to protect us all against new variants.
1	I am vaccinated for my protection and others
1	This "situation" is destroying people mentally, you are bond to see this happen more and more. And also some people have lost everything and one should be carefull of someone who has nothing to lose.
1	Vaccines are doing their jobs though. Hospitalization and death among the vaccinated are extremely low
0	The polio vaccine provides lifelong immunity and is the only means of polio prevention. Can the same be said of the covid vaccine?
0	Vaccines don't work. You can still get the virus, you can still die from it. Just like with the flu vaccines. So what's next?
0	I never HAD the covid never will so I’m not keen on getting it
1	We have a vaccine and folks still playing dumb. Smh. Ruining for everyone else .
0	Spike proteins damaged him internally. Oh wait, I'm just an old retiree that isn't qualified to comment. NO SHOT FOR ME!!!
0	My platelets are borderline low already. Makes me wonder if I’m more susceptible to ITP from this vaccine.
0	The American Association of Physicians and Surgeons have been against this whole Covid scare from the very beginning amd have been against all restrictions and especially no need for a dangerous untested vaccine!This is sinister!
1	remember to get both shots AND avoid situations until a few weeks after the second shot. I had a helluva terrible reaction to second Moderna, 24 hours of pure shit but it sure beats covid.
0	I will never take that vaccine..... They can keep it!!!
1	I don't trust vaccines made by Big Pharma, so I'm taking this horse dewormer........made by Big Pharma.
0	Also, the vaccine will kill you before then. Good luck on killer Vax!
1	Duh. Vaccines work.
0	I won't be taking the vaccine but thank you for the explanations. I hope it will convince some people to get vaccinated.
0	Vaccines are lethal.. Do not become a victim. Reptilians built vaccines. Dont use it
0	So done with all of this, let us have a free choice not. It is my body my choice
0	ive it time we will all have side effects.  My health has done nothing but go down hill since I've been vaccinated.
0	I'm vaccinated and wish I wasnt. Don't need one, didn't want one. But bought into the promise that we could end this nonsense if I got one.
0	I think I'll give my immune system a whirl and avoid your jib jab.
0	It's more like the vaccine give you PERMANENT illnesses and leads you to death.
0	I’m unvaccinated, my immediate family is unvaccinated and I will NEVER require my staff to vaccinate.
1	When a person dies of covid, the conspiracy nutjobs will immediately blame poor health and not the virus. However, if a vaccinated person dies for any reason, they'll blame the vaccine and nothing else.  This is how you can tell that the conspiracy nutjobs are really desperate and I love it.
0	No thank you , I won't even get the vaccine, I don't need it.
1	About 192 Million of us are vaccinated, only the republicans are the hold-outs 138 million [unvaccinated] causing the problems
0	Fuck the vaccine poison. These stories are a lot more common than they seem. Social Media and the news are suppressing horror stories caused by vaccine.
1	@lmauricecpr Masked, vaxxed and keeping my distance.
0	PLANDEMIC
1	As a young person, I feel so grateful to have access to the mRNA vaccine for reducing the chance of experiencing long term complications from the COVID-19 virus, including hospitalisation or death.
1	I hope that when everyone is vaccinated, we will forget about COVID-19 just as we've forgotten about polio.
1	Getting a COVID-19 vaccination is a safer and more dependable way to build immunity to COVID-19 than getting sick with COVID-19. I will take the vaccine.
1	He’s now a spokesman for why you should be vaccinated.
0	So let me get this straight ... Moderna signs a deal for an mRNA vaccine BEFORE China reveals that there is an outbreak!
1	rich countries need to ensure the vaccine is available for all so that people can be together again and not be afraid of catching or passing on covid 19
0	My father passed away due to vaccine he was healthy happy he got his first shot of Pfizer vaccine and the next day he passed away !
0	Anyone hear of natural immunity?
0	Trust your deepest intuition no matter how many people try to convince you otherwise. Why would you allow anyone to inject toxic chemicals into your body as a test subject when there has not been sufficient testing and it has not been proven safe?
1	Have the courage to risk a vaccination - No one who’s had one hasn’t been at least a little unsure. We have a chance to get COVID after a vaccination - the only other choice is to get COVID without one.
1	The only way to stop from catching a virus is eradicating it entirely, with most viruses or diseases like COVID-19 Delta strain is most part impossible so the vaccine strengthens your immune system so you can live with the virus in a safe way.
1	Yes! Lets not give any vaccine to China
1	Thank you to all the scientists who toiled long, long hours to make both positive and negative discoveries that got us to an effective vaccine. How lucky is the world today that some scientists did not chase the money/grants that are so necessary to survive as a research scientist, but decided to work in obscure fields that were not popular, so to speak. To those who say this vaccine is experimental, do they realize the discoveries began in 1960? Scientific studies, by definition, are experimental. That's what scientists do, experiment until they refine whatever it is they're working on. Proving a negative can be as helpful or more as proving a positive. And that this came together from several different sets of scientists studying different variations of coronavirus, mRNA etc. Society as a whole owes you all a great debt. Again, thank you.
1	You made a choice not to get vaccinated, but 10 Billion doses have been administered, safest vaccine rollout in the world, and you are still whining about the choice you made. 90% of drivers who actually cross the border *are* vaccinated, & lots of work for you elsewhere.
1	Vaccines are the only way out. If it's left to run wild it will mutate more.
1	The vaccine works, and the vaccinated are going back to normal, if anti vaxxers don’t want to get the vaccine and go back to normal, then anti vaxxer can stay locked away if the want
0	Did anyone bother to ask about the effectiveness of the vaccines ? I mean he’s on his 3rd dose and he has Covid
1	In the 3rd world country, almost everyone wants to get vaccinated, but we don't have access to enough vaccines. Can we just have your vaccines then?
1	My wife is 6 months pregnant and we've already gotten the fetus 2 shots and 5 boosters. She's still not fully protected though..
1	Natural selection in action. The anti-vaxxer problem will take care of itself if we are lucky.
1	It is the unvaccinated who are putting pressure on our already overstretched NHS and the sooner they realise it the better.
0	The biggest concerns are about potential unknown long-term effects and serious side effects of the vaccine
0	A USELESS injection.......wtf
1	Antivax people great job on single handedly dooming us all. I wish we could send you all to mars where you belong as you clearly lack the common sense the rest of us have
0	All in government, media and healthcare including the pharmaceutical companies will be held accountable for these crimes..  Crimes against humanity for all the above.
1	Got pfizer today first dose! Feeling sore in the arm. Other than that no issue. Its been 7 hrs.
0	Every time you get the vaccine, a CEO buys a new house in the south of France.
1	I just got the first vaccine. My arm is a little sore (the same amount of soreness I get from a flu shot). That's the only symptom. I feel perfectly fine otherwise!
0	How can anyone say a drug that doesn't have any long-term test results yet is totally safe? That's the main reason I'm skeptical about it.
1	It's mid March and finally decided to take it. Your video answered every question I had, I'm extremely grateful. 60yr. old and not in the best of health, but moving forward with vaccine and hoping for the best.... God bless.
0	Broadcasters being ridiculous trying to correlate everything negative with unvaccinated people…
0	Fully vaccinated, yes and this does not help, people get wise.
1	Wont matter to the antivaxxers, they have long since rejected reality. Any information that goes against their believes will be denounced as false.
1	Unvaccinated people get boggled easily, since they never started with a full deck.
0	You aren't what you eat. Don’t be sheep.
0	Doesn't work. I had covid without the vaccine and it barely lasted 3 days. Wasn't anything worse than a cold. All my friends and family are primarily unvaccinated and reported the same thing. This is evil, nothing more, nothing less.
0	Vaccine Immunity (man made and subjected to unending dependency on govt controlled booster shots) and your natural immunity eventually fade with each booster shots. VS. Natural Immunity ( God made and requires simple  therapeutic drugs as boosters) The choice is yours!
0	So being an unvaccinated in Australia now comes to the point, where you, your rights and the things you enjoy wont exist.Considering if you dont bend the knee, you basically cant go out unless near dead anyway, so wonder if renouncing citizenship will afford some justice to it.
1	Go get your vaccine bro
1	Roaring ‘20’s, here we come! I hate throwing parties, but I am throwing a rager after I get this damn vaccine.
1	Trained doctor: "The side effects are one in a million" Internet mom: "no"
0	What’s wrong with waiting a little bit to see the effects of this new vaccine? Nothing wrong with doing some due diligence first
1	My otherwise healthy nine year old son is in the hospital with COVID pneumonia. Protect our children. Get vaccinated.
0	What about the people who are vaccinated and still dying for covid-19 .. no one wants to talk about that. I guess blame.it.on unvaccinated people
0	SAY NO TO THE POISION VACCINE.. IT KILLS YOU! ONLY GOD CAN HEAL US!!!
1	You're spending too much time online really.  The vaccine worked, Look where we are now?
1	get every dose of that vaccine
1	getting the vaccine tomorrow im scawwed
1	The covid vaccine is also about keeping others safe
0	I've seen so many videos saying we all should get it, but sorry to say I'm out and won't get the vaccine. Only God can tell whether or not its the end of my journey. Respect my pov. Thank you and please stay safe everyone!
0	The moment I can sue for covid vaccine  complications I'll get it but I've been fine since it started
0	Do a basic search for vaccine approval process and you'll see normally it takes an average of 10yrs for full approval.
0	I’m not for vaccines and proud of it.
1	Unvaxxed children: exist Measles and polio: is this free real estate?
0	I'm skeptical about the vaccine. Not so much the medicine....but the idea I've heard about putting a chip in it. No way!!
1	You are rioting against the vaccines because of conspiracy theories while every data proves vaccine works safely
0	why does someone who was vaccinated still gets covid-19? That simply means the vaccines don't work against covid-19
0	He's not that stupid to get vaccinated. Everybody knows that Nadal wouldn't have one if there was integrity in sport and he was allowed to play. He'll go down as the greatest tennis player for making a stand against the biggest scamdemic of all time.
1	People so dramatic lmao, it’s just a shot, you get so many shots in your life, who cares as long as it helps u
1	Made it through the snow for the #CovidVaccine thank you to all the hard work by scientists and clinicians to makeâ€
1	The Omicron variant was a stark warning of the consequences of global vaccine inequality. I've joined 300+ scientists to tell the government to clear away patents and let low and middle-income countries manufacture Covid-19 vaccines. #PeoplesVaccine
0	The shots are safe. Tell that to all the athletes who were in top physical condition and died on the soccer fields in Europe. Guess they didn't get the placebo like American athletes get.
0	It's not a vaccine. Its a trial on gene therapy and you all are the lab rats.
1	actually it's been proven that vaccinated kids are more likely to have autism, because the ones that aren't vaccinated are dead
0	I find it odd that our government is extremely generous when it comes to vaccines, but not antibody tests
1	no, it's not being forced in a sneaky way. You have no  "human right" to come into my home or business if you're unvaccinated, and I don't want unvaccinated people there. Where do you get your ridiculous ideas about human rights? I'm sure it's not something you've given deep philosophical thought, but rather, claptrap you've picked up from an echo chamber.  You're not vaccinated? I have a human right to keep you away from me on my property, and even, in public facilities. You don't want to wear pants? Same thing.  You DO NOT have a "human right" to infect me. Where did you get the outsized sense of privilege you have?
0	Approval doesn’t mean much when it comes to the covid vaccine or boosters.
1	I was single jabbed here in the uk, im a 32 year old man and my Girlfreind is 27 and we both tested positive for Covid  3 days in and we're really sick. It's such a struggle to even get out of bed but we have a 1 year to look after so we have no choice. It's tough. Believe me get your jabs. Im glad we did because it could have been a lot worse.
1	My cousin was an avid antivaxxer. He died a few days ago from Covid after spending months in the hospital. He went from a ventilator to a tracheotomy. He left all of his anti vax crap up all over his Facebook page up til the very end. It's horribly sad.
0	Two reasons: - I dont want state to force me to do medical procedures - if vaccines are working, it's dysgenic program. I want my race to be strong. We need evolutionary stressors
0	I have a family member in hospital with nerve damage from the astrazeneca. I'm not going to tell people to have this jab or not but please look into it before you decide.
0	If it's safe, why are the vaccine companies refusing to be held liable legally in case their vaccine causes damage to the people who receive it?
0	Imagine being vaccinated and still have to wear a mask
1	Vaccination is good
1	well done, I have now had both of my jabs, I feel safer now, and I am hoping if more and more get their jabs the world can move on and perhaps covid can die out.
1	It’s been thoroughly tested.  But even if it is less effective/safe than advertised, it’s still gotta be better than the alternative.
0	It's so safe that all these companies have 100% indemnity so we're supposed to trust their product more than them? If nobody complied they'd actually have to relinquish their indemnity, bunch of overly compliant serfs, I stand on principle alone, not taking something from someone who has zero liability - shove it!
0	At one time not that long ago, doctors encouraged smoking even for pregnant women. Of corise, now we know how damaging smoking is to the human body.  What will we learn about the #CovidVaccine 5/10 years from now?
0	I'm sorry but a vaccine that was developed in such a short time cannot possibly have no side effects.
0	I got the vaccine because I didn't want to lose my job and now I have heart problem( myocarditis and pericarditis) after the first dose with Pfizer- I lost my job and for the next 3-6 months no job. Government is playing with people's life.
0	The entire world has realized that Covid isn't going anywhere, and the government can't make it.
0	Vaccine doesn't prevent anything.
1	Finger crossed for Pfizer vaccine
0	The companies don't have to care about adverse reactions or deaths because they have no liability.
1	I took my two shots and felt wonderful, invigorated, brimming with vitality.  I will be taking my booster shot
0	Oh good, now we can get another shot that we don’t know what it is going to do to us!!
1	Suzanne Robertson said (she was) not vaccinated. “I would die first,” Robertson said. From your lips to God’s ears!
1	Where vaccines differ from the other things you listed is that if you’re vaccinated your probability of transmitting the disease gets lower as well. It’s not just a personal decision it also affects everyone you meet or even people that shop at the same stores as you. Getting vaccinated helps protect others, not just yourself
1	I'm wondering when people start intentionally infecting themselves with covid and rather take this risk instead of taking the totally awesome, totally safe and totally effective heavenly vaccine.
0	The vaccine cult remind me of Homer when LIsa sells him the rock that protects against bears.
0	“The fact that you didn’t have more severe symptoms maybe you can thank the vaccine?” Um, no. Even the CDC says you are not “protected” by these vaccines until 2 weeks after the second shot.
0	since I have had COVID my body is equipped to fight the virus as it did the second time I got covid
1	i definitely agree, it should be mandated for travel so you dont get other people sick
1	MRA vaccines took 50 years to develop AND data across the world shows it saved millions of lives. Perhaps acknowledge you're not a scientist, this listen to the advice from the scientific community
1	Wherever you are, you can continue to protect our people by getting a COVID-19 vaccine and booster.
1	Had to do it…because the government started restricting my freedoms
0	Why can vaccinated not give blood plasma with the Red Cross? Why are FDA officials resigning?
1	I hope this pandemic has convinced some of the anti vax commuinty that the world without vaccines would not be a good place
0	Whatever is in the jab can’t be undone after you take it, no fda certification, no long term testing, people still getting COVID after getting the jab, many side effects reported, many deaths etc and the government wants to mandate this thing?
1	children are being hospitalised by covid. Not may are dying. Being hospitalised is bad enough to merit a vaccine.
0	Unvaxxed and unmasked since ole covid cold flu started .. amazing that I’m alive… almost like enjoying life, working out regularly, eating a semi healthy diet can lead to a healthy life without the need for 5 shots and 10 free doughnuts from getting said shots 😂 good ole “$cience”
1	Antivaxxers should be sent back to 1855.
1	We asked, and #Michigan #K12 parents answered, with photos of their little patriots who have gotten the #CovidVaccine to protect themselves and others! Thank you to these role models for other kids and teens.
0	SO THERE WAS A FAKE VIRUS WITH A FICTICIOUS NAME PUSHED IN THE FACES OF 325 MILLIION AMERICANS SO A VACCINE CAN BE MADE TO KILL THEM...... WOW! IF THIS IS NOT COMMUNISM I DONT KNOW WHAT IS .... PURE GENOCIDE, THAT BILL GATES HAVE CREATED...
0	Vaccines are extremely good at providing long-lasting immunity… to their manufacturers.
1	Yes please get vaccinated help stop or at least slow it down this virus is not messing around
0	My neighbor died from a massive heart attack the day after she got the vaccine.  She was a healthy and active 58 year old woman with no prior heart condition.
0	I can only speak for myself, but I am against any manipulation of my DNA, because as a believer in Jesus Christ I am obligated to allow god to have his will and not interfere with his divine plan for my life.
0	My body my choice right???? RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!
1	the endless cycle only continues if people dont get the vaccine
1	People dying after getting vaccinated is t the same thing as dying from the vaccine. Correlation does not mean causation. Vaccinated people dying from Covid is infrequent. You can still die wearing a seatbelt or with airbags but the chance you survive the wreck is much greater.
0	The FDA's average length of time it studies and tests a vaccine before approval is over 30 years...
0	As I’ve said from the beginning, the vaccinated are the problem. Older people should get vaccinated, obese people should, but that’s it. All this fear porn has millions of Karens coming out hatefully against anyone without shot
1	“Anti-vaxx” is the new “terrorist;” The blanket statement provided to hide government pedos lying & trying to force the public to take questionable injections (that alter one’s MRNA), treating them as a lab Rat, purely for Pharma greed.
1	I am fully vaccinated and the peace of mind I feel is the opposite of the helplessness I felt for so long. Living with a fully vaccinated person as well. I'm very grateful.
1	i dont want them to die but they sure as hell seem to want to. wed all be better off if theyd get vaccinated or , at least, wear a mask but they refuse to
1	Antivaxxers can go fuck themselves.
1	The vaccine is safe and a majority of the people dying are unvaxxed. There is no other side to those facts. If you decide to not get vaccinated you are making a misinformed decisio
0	Are there any vaccines that are 100% effective? IIRC even the measels vaccine is 93% effective.
1	"Your children will be asked how many vaccines they got!" Um, yeah, we've been doing that for two or three generations already. It's called a medical record.
0	I will NEVER take another vaccine. Never
0	I didn’t get the flu so imma respectfully decline covid vaccine shot
1	Got my vaccine last week, my arm was a little sore but I feel great. We all have to do our part.
1	My wife got covid pneumonia on December 27th. She was sick for 29 days and still hasn't 100% recovered. Of course, she refused the vaccine. But after being sick for a month, she said, "I learned my lesson."
1	I am one of those few who experienced AEFI due to Covid vaccine. I had to be treated every time I received the vaccine, for the side effects. During booster, I fainted within 5 mins after the shot but you won’t see me talk bad about the vaccine because the vaccine works for me.
0	The more covid is spread the more it will mutate and the more it mutates the less effective the vaccine becomes.
0	No to forced or coerced injections.
1	Compulsory or not it is still the right and responsible thing for staff to get vaccinated.
1	I'm 24, fit and healthy - I literally coughed blood when I got COVID. Do yourself a favour and just get vaccinated!
1	When people go into the hospital to be treated for covid, do they ask what’s in the medicine they are receiving for treatment?
1	Meanwhile in other countries people can't wait to get vaccinated. Vaccines save lives.
0	Will this vaccine give me immunity?  Doctor: “It gives Pfizer immunity.”
0	Several people I know who have been vaccinated still ended up getting the virus in the months following 2nd shot and boosters. Not only that, they also had severe discomfort caused by the vaccine itself in the days following inoculation.
1	So many unvaccinated people in my class.🙄
0	When people ask you why you don't get your vaccine, simply respond: The same reason as you, to help people
1	Do not put other peoples' health at risk by not taking the vaccine
0	so if i die after i taken my 2nd and 3rd dose youll just say i died of corona you wont admit its your mistake
1	Covid -19 vaccine is safe to use . Only a few side effects like Mild fever, dizziness, body ache, and pain on injected area. If the fever or reaction takes place do consult your doctor immediately.
0	The vaccines don't work, other than to make big pharma executives and their government partners wealthy.
1	Boosted.  #COVID19 #BoosterDose
0	The fact that can use the logic of “this is a extremely rare side effect” and still force the vaccine but cant use the same logic of its extremely rare for me to die of covid regardless if I’m vaccinated is really aggravating.
0	Humans have been growing for millions of years without vaccines.
1	Wouldn't it be amazing if there was a vaccine or pill that cures all diseases. This is still really great news but I hope someday we reach the level of immunity from every single virus.
1	The unvaccinated are 97 times more likely to die of COVID than the vaccinated. That republicans are killing off their own voters (partially because they're convinced people of color are actually more anti vax, they aren't) is especially insane. As are they.
1	Global death toll from Covid-19 tops 5 million, less than two years into the pandemic.And yet many millions are putting their lives at risk in the belief that Vaccinations are dangerous and wont get vaxxed.
0	The last myth about Pfizer's product collapses! It does not protect against severe cases! #Pfizer #Israel
0	Covid will never end.  It's too profitable for the pharmaceutical companies and allows for governments to exert unprecedented control.  Covid is too valuable to simply end.
0	My body hasn’t approve it. No thanks
0	If they make the vaccine mandatory for travel... Well It was fun while It lasted!
0	He's absolutely right I know so many people that have been vaccinated that have covid and so many would have not been vaccinated do not have covid
0	Well now they will make money in perpetuity, similar to the flu vaccine. Every year they will sell this crap.
1	Opponents of vaccination do not argue rationally. Just like the comedians who are against 5G or believe in globuli.
0	Why did they refuse it? Because the state doesnt own our body and its illegal to force ANY medical procedure upon anyone. That and they are seeing the side effects of these 'jabs' every single day...
0	It's not a vaccine, it's an experimental medical trial in its final phase. This is dangerous disinformation which would get thrown out in a court of law. "Stay safe" yourself matey!
1	You don’t listen to doctors speaking on Covid prevention, but you listen to the doctors to treat you for Covid 🤔
0	My mother was fully vaccinated though she got infected with covid and passed away.
1	Get vaccinated you fucks
0	Hard pass on a vaccine
1	I am fully vaccinated with a booster. But until more people get their first shot, I fear the additional variants to come. I am elderly but have a new grandson I would like to be around to get to know. I am so frustrated by the misinformation people are being fed. It’s all emotionally exhausting!
1	I have had 3 Pfizer vaccines now, no complaints at all. Happy Christmas!
1	He was smart to get something to protect himself.  The vaccine has helped millions. Not dying was the whole point.Having a bad cold is different.
0	I have never had any vaccines, my retarded brother had some vaccines they made him retarded
0	So is the vaccine guaranteed not to have any long term side effects? If so how was it tested for long term side effects in a span of less than an year? That's right, it couldn't. I won't take the vaccine.
1	The side effects are very serious and common, such as an increased lifespan, protection from incredibly painful or awful diseases.
0	This is TOTALITARIANISM through and through !!! With Covid, all major pillars of western values like: human rights, liberty, own-body autonomy, privacy, consent, freedom from fear / coercion / discrimination / persecution are all out of the window, down the drain, blown up to pieces !!! So, they are ALL LIES and PROPAGANDA, used only to brainwash the non-western world, and as excuses to invade resources-rich countries !!!
1	People have the right to die the way they like: with ignorance and disgrace.
1	To get natural immunity, you would have to get COVID and survive COVID....It's been here for two years, why haven't we reached herd immunity by now?
1	Another good vaccine? Bring it on!!!
0	Just Say No...Sorry not Happening.
1	You can choose between decreasing your risk of dying or getting infected and still won't take it? Are you dumb?
0	I have never gotten a vaccine in my life and I am perfectly healthy🙏🏼
1	My dad is anti-vaxx and I’m using your video as one of my sources as why he’s absolutely insane. Thank you for this video.
1	You were thorough and put my mind at ease regarding the vaccine. I wish I had a doctor like you who explained things with so much passion and compassion.
0	Don't get vx. It's a lie.
0	This is getting ridiculous at this point. Stop it with the Booster nonsense.
1	Let me just get this clear, Ron DeSantis won't promote a proven vaccine, yet will promote a COVID-19 treatment that does not work?
0	We want medicine, remedy and cure for this. Not vaccines. We are not laboratory rats !!!
0	If people can still spread it with any of the increasing number of vaccines, then how can you say that the problem is that not EVERYONE on the planet is vaxxed? It's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
1	Reading the comments after getting my vaccine and having zero side effects sure hits a lot differently. Guys the vaccine is not that bad!
1	I love how people that aren’t doctors disagree with real doctors because they “did their own research.”
0	Look up the impact of Carbon nano-onions on Hydra vulgaris . They are both in the jab .
1	If they have to continue making stuff up to scare people, it just proves the vaccine is safe and effective.
1	vaccines were never made to make you immune. They make you resistant, vaccines work by literally giving you a weaker dose of COVID so your body can build up a resistance to the virus, you can still contract and die from COVID but the chances of doing so are much smaller
0	Offcourse the vaccine caused the death
0	All they keep emphasizing is unvaccinated people are more likely to get covid. But why are fully vaccinated with boosters still catching it? I'm confused at this point.
1	Not carrying out mass vaccination would only prolong the pandemic.
1	I have been waiting so long to see NY rangers play!!
1	I feel like Darwin's becoming more and more relevant with all those conspiracy theorists regarding the vaccines.
0	reality deniers has been used up by many. A "lockdown for lunatics," as some call it
1	Your odds of getting a blood clot from Covid vs the vaccine is exponentially higher
0	I will wait until see all effects on people.good luck
1	a good start would be to deal with all the anti-vaxx nonsense that gets posted on this comments section on a daily basis
1	Thank you. Unfortunately, most science deniers will just ignore you. Some people fail to appreciate the effort of dedicated health workers, virologist, physicians. Thank You
1	it isn't going to cause any harm getting vaccinated, so no
1	The vaccine is a great thing, and people should take advantage of it
0	I'm not getting it no matter what.
0	These vaccines have always been about making money.
0	If it becomes "mandatory", I'll just pay the nurse to shoot it in the sink and record that I had it. I'm never accepting this fraud.
1	The jab is safer than a paracetamol
1	Two fully vaccinated kiddos! Sad that a six-year-old and a ten-year-old have more courage than millions of cowardly and ignorant antivaxxers!
0	These vaccines were rushed.
1	I have taken all Covid vaccination recommended by the CDC & FDA including the booster. I have had NO adverse reactions from them, and neither has the rest of my family.
1	#VaccinationCovid | "Yes, the vaccine can have desirable effects". We are launching an awareness campaign to encourage and convince people to use #vaccination
1	Think about it like Russian roulette. Unvaxxed has one chamber loaded out of six. Vaxxed has one out of a 400 round magazine.
0	This has passed China ccp level.
1	These people: “I don’t know what’s in it.”  Also these people: “Please give me seven different drugs in my IV and monoclonal antibodies.”
0	Stay safe. Stay away from anyone pushing the jab!
0	It only protects you from getting fired from your job lol
0	Because the vaccine is completely worthless. Early effective treatment is cheap and available but they are deliberately demonizing them inorder to promote forced vaccination.
1	Oh yeah, absolutely. People think antivax idiots are a new thing. Did you know the phrase "conscientious objector" originally referred, not to those who chose not to go to war, but to the British folks in the 1890s who were opposed to taking the smallpox vaccine?
1	CAUTION: I TURNED INTO A LIZARD AFTER MY 1ST COVID SHOT…
1	Hurray!! I received my vaccination today and experienced some minor hand discomfort.
1	I'm vaccinated and encourage others to do the same, but I support the nurse. Nobody should lose their job because they refuse a vaccine. We have bodily autonomy, and it's nobody's business but our own about what gets injected to it.
1	I have had 2 Covid jabs and I get my booster shot tomorrow morning. I am still here and I am still healthy, my genetics have not changed, big shoutout and Thank you's to the scientists and health care professionals and all those working to keep us all safe from this awful disease.
0	Why would you take a vaccine that hasnt been tested and proven over years
1	If you do you’re putting yourself at unknown risk as the vaccines haven’t gone through the proper long term safety checks
0	Doesn't being on the fourth shot tell you all you need to know about its efficacy?
0	I’ve played WAAAY too much resident evil. If I take this vaccine, will I become a zombie? I’d rather be fighting zombies than become one.
1	It is easy….no medical treatment for voluntary unvaxxed…
1	Think I lost major brain cells trying to understand why they won't vaccinate their kids.
0	THE TRUTH WILL SURELY COME OUT!!!! Big pharma is EVIL
0	It's ridiculous that ANYONE is considering putting an "experimental"(legally classified) vaccine to a virus that is a bio-weaponized viral hybrid.This was created in a lab, and as the probe goes deeper into the situation it turns out that words were replaced and redefined in order that the denial could be without perjury.
1	I've had 3 now. 2 Pfizers and a Moderna. I'm going to book my 4th booster in Feb. I'll get as many as they'll let me. I want to not only protect myself but my friends and family too. It's the logical thing to do.
0	Holy Moses, this must be stopped before all of our natural immunsystem closes down by the gene theraphies. God save the people
0	Naw, only Sheeple take the jab
0	100,000 healthcare workers- including consultants, midwives, GP’s & nurses would rather run for the hills than take this jab…& that’s not counting millions more worldwide….wonder why? Surely if it were safe as houses there’d be no issues
1	Anti Vax is just code for "too lazy to read."
1	Since it reduces your chance of dying from covid by over 90%…..yeah, I’d say it VERY good for your health.
1	Vaccinated have less severe or no symptoms. So less likely to transmit by sneezing or coughing on others. Therefore, reduces chance of transmitting covid.
0	Never mind Anti vaccine what about those who have died within 28 days of taking their vaccine
1	got my 1st dose of pfizer vaccine about an hour ago
0	Your natural immune system is best
1	I would take the COVID vaccine and I would do it as soon as possible. Reason is that the virus is picking up mutations and the efficacy against new variants maybe reduced. The vaccine will have to be modified and if you miss this round you may have to wait a while.
0	Getting one is already extremely dangerous
0	Yes... protect the vaccinated from the unvaccinated by taking the vaccine that did not protect the vaccinated in the first place. Then enjoy your heart inflammation, blood clot or Guillian Barre autoimmune syndrome.
1	They should use vaccine such as Moderna or Aztra/zeneca with 100%  effectiveness  and accuracy, not the others with 95%.
1	Antivaccination movements were on the fringes of society before COVID. Perhaps even more than the deaths the antivaccine movement has been an even worse consequence…
0	How about the vaccine related injuries? What about miscarriages being over 400% higher with women who take the vaccine? How about facebook deleting a 70k+ large group of people sharing covid vaccine injuries? Are those not reasons to refuse the vaccine?
0	Since I have my COVID vaccine I feel that my both legs and foot are always cramping that I don’t have before , my arms always numbness and hurting!
0	People who choose the vaccine are people who choose to listen to every word they hear without checking it out for themselves for their own safety. We live in the universe of life wherein our natural immune systems are fully functional when we listen to the spirit of the universe and follow the guidance that comes with it. Some people feel they need to align with the government-system-infrastructure and are not really awake to living their own spiritually guided lives. Be awake. Be happy. Love. Peace. Truth. Healing. Nutrition. Life.
1	i remember just a few short months ago some people said if you are afraid and need to have everyone wear a mask, just stay home. Ok, now if you are unvaccinated and refuse to wear a mask just stay home
1	Do not listen to delusional idiots who believe it is unnecessary for young healthy people. Even if you survive getting infected, you can still infect others in turn. And this is entirely aside from the long term effects of Covid infection. Get your damn shot unless an actual medical professional tells you that you are allergic.
1	The facts are the facts, while you may disagree with them, that doesn't change them at all. The vaccines are very good at reducing your chances of being hospitalised or dying of COVID-19. #VaccinesSaveLives
1	Government can play great role in ensuring vaccine to every citizen of their country
0	Herd immunity is when you have IMMUNITY. None of the vaccines help with this because they DO NOT offer immunity! Immunity means ZERO breakthrough cases not 1,000's per day!
0	Now that this is approved, I'm going to get it. If it's been given full approval I have no reason to believe it is any more or less dangerous than any other vaccine I've gotten.
0	The vaccine made me pretty sick for a full week. I would not get it again.
1	I will take my vaccine jam this afternoon, you should do the same!
0	Dictatorships never last long (especially when they are against the most basic human rights). These vaccines will never prevail!
0	Not 1,2 or 3.. Tks!
1	This doctor knows what he's talking about.
0	Get the Vax so you don't get the sickness AS bad? Lmao nah no thanks you can have my dose
0	There are plenty of reasons why people refuse to be vaccinated.
1	I also had the first Pfizer vaccine and the only symptom was a bruised feeling arm, especially the next day. I found it uncomfortable to sleep on and that disturbed my sleep, making me tired. 4 days later, no arm pain at all :)
0	The lied about the masks, they lied about the lockdowns and they lied about the vaccines. None of it worked!
1	Dr. Campbell, I was very happy to see you speaking today about the J&J vaccine, I am in the US trial for the Jansen J&J vaccine and excited that it is a big step closer to being able to help get this crisis under control. I appreciate your videos each day and all that you are doing.
0	Take a vaccine for a virus with a 99% survivability rate? No thanks. I'll take my chances. I've had the common cold (covid) many times. I lived. This is about control. Nothing more
1	I have lost faith in humanity....
0	If we need the answer to how harmful the vaccines may be we have to start counting non covid deaths from the day of the first jab not 30 days after the 2nd dose.
1	As a person with serious illnesses, that occasionally needs emergency services, I really think that all rescue and health professionals should be required to be vaccinated or go on non-paid leave until the pandemic is over. I've fought too long and hard, to survive metastatic breast cancer and a damaged heart, to get exposed to COVID because someone, who is supposed to be dedicated to providing safe, competent medical care, didn't want to get vaccinated. The same rule should apply to all police officers who interact with the public. They swear to protect and serve and they can't protect us if they are exposing us to a lethal disease.
1	If you do not take the vaccine pls unfriend me me
1	Got my first vaccine(Pfizer) this past thursday, my arm was sore for 2 days, feeling good, hopefully we can end this nightmare (covid)
1	Life doesn't feel normal because life isn't normal, yet We *will* get through this Get vaccinated + boosted + keep wearing a mask
1	I'll bet that many anti-vax'ers would change their minds if insurance companies stopped paying hospitalization and related fees when they and their family contract Covid. All of our insurance premiums are paying for anti-vax'ers , AKA Republicans! Where is the outrage!!!
0	There is a no liability clause on all vaccinations since 1983.
1	I want to heartily thank EVERYONE who has done so much to develop, research, provide information, support, keep facilities super-clean, and encourage us to get COVID-19 vaccines. So many have joined up to help.
0	Why are we pumping kids with an experimental vaccine that don’t work in adults let alone 99 percent of children won’t have any issues with covid
0	why would you mandate a vaccine that doesn't work? if I take a vaccine against measles I'm protected against measles but if I take a vaccine against covid I'm not protected against covid... so why mandate that stuff?
1	Yes, until you’re struggling for oxygen in the local hospitals ICU and expect everyone else to pay for it.
0	I took it, both shots and still got a walloping case that put me down for a week. Vaccine my ass.
1	Vaccine is meant to give you a better chance at fighting it, not immunity to it
1	So disgusted with the non believers. We would all be dead if we hadn’t had science
0	Hybrid immunity .. the vaccine offers no immunity though
0	Till they pray and still get C and have to get their 100th booster.... oh no
1	We need to get the whole world vaccinated
1	Why is the media giving the unvaccinated a voice now🤔.
0	We need more people like her here in Australia as everyone seems to have their heads in the sand over the vaccine
0	Yes, I am getting vaccinated now, but only because the self-tests are no longer accepted or can no longer be carried out at all, which really annoys me.
0	You're allowed to question medicine. But not vaccines. Never vaccines!
0	So many families have been waiting for this???? Are you high? No one wants this for their kids and if they do they should not be parents period!
1	Great. People who refuse to get vaccinated are stupid. I said what I said.
1	They want medical science to save them if hospitalized, yet won’t save themselves with a vaccine created with the same scientific process.
1	Thank you for coming on the air to tell everyone that the vaccine is 100% safe.
0	Give me a break, and count me out. I am educated and made an informed decosion.....NO
1	I’m 64, and had my vaccines (“Better safe than sorry”). My 75-year-old husband refuses to get his. I guess he wants out of this marriage, and wants to leave me widowed a second time
1	I believe the regulatory authorities of the FDA. As well, From all open reports (apart from unsubstantiated bald claims of conspiracy lovers) the protection in better than expected and the safety (remembering that the vaccine doesn’t provide protection from trucks or pre-existing heart disease) is excellent.  I’m vaccinated despite my reservations about the emergency approval and safety problems with feline coronavirus vaccine (FIP). We’re all guinea pigs to some extent for the first couple of years. Everyone is free to choose the virulent COVID-19 virus with the attendant hazards. Good luck to us all
0	“How could you convince those parents it’s a good idea” why are they trying to convince us? This is bogus..
0	A good friend of mine passed away from a massive heart attack the day after her second Covid shot. She was otherwise very healthy.
0	Thanks for the video. After taking both Fizer and Oxford doses I have been having shortness of breath and phlegm. Here I am 5 months later and I'm definitely sure that my body is not the same as it was before I was forced to take 2 shots. I am so mad about this actually.
0	Experts? Why is it when the actual creator of these MRNA vaccines warns against taking the vaccines and to absolutely not give them to your children, he is ignored? Many experts have come out against the vaccines and are ignored? Has anyone notice that DailyMail would have never posted anything with the word "COVID" in it let alone anything negative about the vaccines until just recently? I guess the damage is done, mission accomplished.
1	I just got fully vaccinated two days ago
0	I’ve never been so excited to get a vaccine
0	My sweet aunt was found dead in her driveway by my uncle almost 24 hours after getting the vaccine. What a horrifying thing to come home to after a long day of work. My family is devastated. She was 53 years old. Rest In Peace aunt Andrea.
0	It's fascinating to see parents stop at WholeFoods and load up on a bunch of organic groceries after leaving their pediatrician who just injected their kids with polysorbate 80, formaldehyde, MSG, aluminum & mercury
1	Thank you for the easy to understand information on Covid and how vaccines work. Even for me at my 79 years young.   Pity the antivaxxers, many of young ages cannot understand simple things!
1	feel a lot better about my decision to get vaccinated now.
1	This by definition means that the vaccine is protective against myocarditis. Yeah I said it
0	Long covid is the after effects of catching covid when you've had the "vaccine", it affects the body more than a normal infection.
1	I'll get the vaccine when I can
1	You can’t heal what she had. Hopefully people will see what has happened to her and get the vaccine .
0	I don't get vaccinated because my body formed antibodies after Covid disease that have been consistently high for 1 1/2 years and are over 300 or have now increased to this level and have never decreased.
1	First time in history that the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who haven't taken it.
1	Making vaccines available to all is an important step, although I firmly believe that the ever more slippery slope towards compulsory vaccination is a sliding step too far... being double-jabbed & boosted is my choice, but I absolutely respect those who make a different choice.
1	Vaccination is the most effective response we know of. I have said it, I have written it, I repeat it.
0	So I need to inject the vaccine in MY body so YOU can feel safe even though you are vaccinated? Lmfao. Make it make sense people. Yet the unvaccinated people are the "dumb ones."
0	Why did they stop testing for the flu? Where did the flu go? How accurate are the C19 tests?
0	As a Nurse and giving this covid19 vaccine to community for months,I do respect the “RIGHTS” of each individual.But recently I was mandated to get the vaccine myself when I don’t want to and that may cost losing my job serving others which is sad.
1	I listened to a news story on my computer, and they said that vaccines should last for years. I hope they are right as I am so big on prayers. I believe prayers really work a lot of times.
1	Let's lockdown all the unvaccinated.
0	Third additional shot of the COVID-19 vaccine is said to reactivate the body to fight against the coronavirus, training our body to recognize and better defend itself against the coronavirus should we be exposed.
1	i just wanna know how long it's gonna be before covid is mild enough that i dont have to get tested and quarantine every time i'm possibly exposed. and i dont have to worry about every single event potentiallly getting cancelled due to cases rising. i'm almost afraid that even when it gets way less severe, people will still be so traumatized that they will want to isolate whenever someone has it. im just tired of it. i'm very pro vax, pro mask, taking covid seriously. but i want my life back. and i almost feel like all the work i've done so far has just delayed me getting covid, not actually helpsd get the world back to "normal"
0	The jabbed are the victims of big pharma..they will only suffer those consequences
1	The best explanations I have heard so far. I am fully vaxed and thankful for it. Thank you for doing this debunking video.
1	When you are up to date on COVID-19 vaccination, you can resume many activities with proper precautions (e.g., mask wearing in indoor public spaces).
0	I have a serious question, why isn't there ANY talk of alternative treatments to Covid-19?
1	Vaccines made a disease that basically everyone got yearly with many deaths into a really small possibilty of unharmful side effects
0	Our Immune system is smarter than a politician and scientists. Don't vaxx!
0	Its so rare, it keeps happening, I'm good with my natural immunity, Thanks
1	Get the vaccine! That is the best way to stay healthy from Covid-19! It’s science and common sense.
1	Just a lil personal experience but I got covid at 17 and I am someone with a very weak immune system and autoimmune illnesses, so when covid hit me I straight up was almost hospitalized. I'm doing so much better now and I have my covid vaccines. I really wish ppl could actually give a fuck about this virus bc ppl like me are most affected by their dumb actions
1	Most of large employers require vaccination from employees. At least I know now that I can feel more confident to go again to some of them. TJMAXX shopping this weekend! You have my full support!
0	DO NOT try to tell me again, that I need to get vaccinated. At the least, it doesn't protect against the virus
0	I looked up the study and it only talks about whether or not you CAN get pregnant. It’s not a study on long-term health effects of children born to parents who got the vaccine. We haven’t even had enough time to study that. That’s my concern
1	Idk why people are scared of mRNA, its exciting new technology & times, and is the natural human progression in vaccines
0	There’s a difference between being against a Gene editing rna “vaccine” and being against taking regular vaccines that have been around for a long time
0	no u dont need a vaccine all u need is good food if u have a healthy body then u can fight any virous do not listen to this guy it has mercury in the vaccince and this is a poisoning so keep away from the vaccince it can do moor harm to ur boddy
1	I hope all the anti vaxx Karens and Chads rage quit, can t get unemployment, and can t find a job
0	The greatest lie ever told is that vaccines are safe and effective.
1	Vaccine is the only solution to keep the world safe and get rid of pandemic.
1	“The government trying to fill our bodies with stuff”. I GUARANTEE this woman has fed her kids McDonald’s MULTIPLE times without a second thought.
1	I spent over two weeks waiting to have my shattered clavicle surgically repaired because the hospitals were all full. Refusing a vaccine is selfish.
0	Try Fruits and Vegetables instead of chemicals and injections!!  That alternative is more safe and NO side effects!!
0	No thank you. I'll trust my natural immunity
1	viral load is less in vaxed then unvaxed
0	It is really often very sad how one is also attacked from one's own ranks because one is still not vaccinated and therefore no longer socially acceptable.
1	I'm all for safety, but damn, we need those vaccines now. Wish there was a voluntary system where people who wanted to take the vaccine could.
0	I just took the vaccine cuz it’s required by my college, otherwise I wouldn’t have taken it.
1	It’s because of #Republicans like this POS that #covid is still running rampant. Wear a mask, get vaccinated, and watch how fast our hospitals empty out and our country really can move on without Covid restrictions.
1	Whether you believe or dont believe in masks anyone who shoots someone over a mask is insane.
1	I got 2 doses. I'm not afraid of needles.
1	I got my vaccine yesterday :)
0	What you were saying goes against what science has proven over and over and over again natural immunity is better than a vaccine. Every time.
1	DO NOT listen to those saying not to take it. Someone said you should only take a vaccine if it is something deadly… I’d say that if alive, the millions that have died would tell you how deadly COVID-19 is. The proof is in the bodies. I had my own fonts thinking this is something that was rushed but it took a year of scientists around the world working non stop to delve lip these vaccines. Also, it’s up to you to outweigh the pros and the cons. I prefer to take the risk of it means I have even a chance at protecting the ones I love, protecting myself and returning to normal. The flu isn’t “deadly” yet people take flu shots all the time. These vaccines will protect you from variants that are even deadlier. It is your choice but ultimately you should listen to science and see what’s going on before you listen to conspiracy theories. I mean every country in the world is giving these vaccines! it also reduces the anxiety you get every time you don’t feel too hot and you think it’s covid. You’d be making the world safer and limiting the transmission of a virus that if allowed to keep on jumping from person to person, it will keep on mutating and creating more deadly strands. Flatten the curve and help us return to normalcy! Thanks for trying to make informed decisions!
0	How can anyone say a drug that doesn't have any long-term test results yet is totally safe? That's the main reason I'm skeptical about it.
0	Now we are sheeps not human.
1	The cases of COVID are once again increase quickly.Get Vaccinated yourself & encourages others to do.Wear mask while going anywhere n aware others too.
0	If anti vaccine means keeping an open mind and considering multiple different treatment methods in addition to the vaccine, then everyone ought to be anti vaccine
1	Protect yourself and your family by getting vaccinated
1	Triple shot here. No regrets at all. I don’t care if you guys get a shot or not but I did. So did all my deep holler conservative family. We are all fine too.
0	If the vaccine works then everyone who took it shouldn't have to worry about us poor bastards that didn't.  If it mutates by the month (maybe week) like it has been then it still doesn't matter.   Funny how that works.
1	Getting vaccinated is NOT a surrender of your liberty, It's an affirmation of , Responsibility, Care  and love for yourself and others.
0	Even if this is true and there is no chance of DNA damage I still believe a more natural way of improving our immune systems is the right way
1	"Parents know their children" Okay. And doctors go to school for like a million years and know the medical info. They don't need to know your kid's favorite color.
0	SMH GOD save the children
0	Great! Can't wait to be forced to take it! Empty spaces left on my vaccine card…
0	Congratulations to all the unvaccinated nhs staff who stood up for what they believe in even if it meant losing their job!
0	It’s causing heart problems and blood clots in people, young and old. I wish I never got the booster.
0	No vaccination card to allow you to do anything if you have natural immunity.
1	To the point, reassuring and factual information delivered without wasting my time. Great video as usual. Thx alot for doing you guys do. Much appreciated ??
1	The pool of vaccinated people is significntly higher than the pool of unvaccinated people, so of course you'll have more vaccinated people in ICU than unvaccinated
1	I would just like to say thank you to all your staff for all they are doing rolling out the covid vaccines. I have just returned from my father having his Covid jab at River Lodge this morning and I was impressed at how efficient the set up was - in and out in 20 minutes
1	I get vaccinated. But it is already the third stitch. I don't really care how many are needed. Anything better than a severe corona course.
0	COVID-19 Immunity > Vaccine immunity. Don't let media fool you to take the shots
0	The biggest question is, why are you trying to force something on me I don't want?
0	You go take the vaccine. Enjoy you serious side effects. Hopefully you will still be alive in a few years but I doubt it. Foolish hybrids
1	I love this ! I'm going now to get vaccinated thank you so much
0	Israel is almost 100% vaccinated...correct? Why Then, if this 'shot' is So Wonderful, are the people of Israel still dying? --The almost constant ignorant answer I keep hearing is: It MAY HAVE been worse if they didn't get the 'shot'. "May Have" are the key words here. <<<May have means they don't know. My government has me SO CONFUSED! First they said get vaccinated...Then they said that it didn't work so I need a 2nd shot...then a 3rd...now a 4th.....WHAT??? Something just isn't sitting right, At least is seems to me.
0	Cant go anywhere because of vaccine passport.
0	Well good for them. I’m not taking it. I’ve never been jabbed with any of the vaccines and I don’t intend on starting now.
0	Get fully vaccinated with the ineffective vaccine that does not stop you from getting or spreading covid.
1	Yeees!!
0	I had a blood clot and that's why I won't ever have another one .. And none of us can be sure it stops people dying .I know of people having had 3 jabs who have been very ill as the Jab has brought on illness and they have died
0	The immune system works! Vaccines are not safe or effective.
1	To give context , the research on the polio vaccine was conducted on 1.3 million children and was approved in less than a year . 6.4 billion covid vaccines have been administered in over a year . Pretty heady research
0	I don’t want it injected into my body.
1	Many dying now are un vaccinated, why are people against the vaccine, we all get vaccinated when we was young, we get vaccinated when we go to certain countries, you have to have your vaccination when you joined the armed forces
0	Godspeed and good luck sheeple.
1	Hell yes I'm getting my freedom shot! I can't wait to stop worrying that a trip to the grocery store could be the death of me or a family member
1	its smart vs dum
1	One Covid vaccine cuts infection rate in all age groups
0	The definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. And yet many of the sheep will continue to line up each time they roll out yet another booster. Oh man, people have gone so insane over this.
1	We weren’t complaining about the flu shot every 12 months! (and not even that many ppl were dying from it!!) but this is where we draw the line?
1	I envy you! Congratulations! I wish I had already received this vaccine. By the way, this vaccine was developed by Germany's Biontech, not by Pfizer. Pfizer distributes it and was responsible for the Phase III testing.
1	Don't spread false information about the vaccine! The fact that you don't want to take vaccine during a pandemic is just crazy
1	If you make a choice to not vaccinate your kids, (Barring a *valid* medical reason) they should be removed from your custody and you should be sterilized.
0	Dude if they make a "vaccine" less than a year then you know somethings up. Especially if the media deletes videos on exposing what the vaccine exactly is!
0	Wow! The experts finally making sense! It only took two years for them to pull their heads put of the sand!
1	I would support vaccination being on the mandatory list for schools once kids are allowed to get it. Antinvaxxers can homeschool.
0	So many people I know took the double dose and still getting sick. This a miracle cure for big pharma profits only
0	Started my vaccine the other day due to workplace mandate. Will never agree with it, and I think people should always be allowed to make their own risk vs benefit decisions.
1	I rlly do suggest taking it, I am fully vaccinated and will receive a booster sometime in the future.
0	New research says omicron is not very dangerkus and natural immunity works!
0	Natural immunity is better.
0	I am a proud anti-vaxxer
1	it works the same way. It may not be made from protein subunits or inactivated viruses. It still primes the immune system to recognize and eliminate a known pathogen while minimizing symptoms. And by minimizing symptoms, it helps protect the vaccinated from more severe symptoms and helps them cope without having to overload the hospitals. The vaccine doesn’t 100% stop transmission - that’s where the masks, social distancing, and hand washing come in play - but it does curb the SPEED of transmission and helps prevent people from becoming human laboratories for variants! And yes, protecting children and the vulnerable means surrounding them with vaccinated people and shielding them from possible spread by wearing masks, maintaining social distance and by washing hands properly. If you refuse to do these things, then do so at your own risk. But don’t come running to the already overloaded hospitals to clamor for treatment once COVID gets you. Healthcare workers shouldn’t have to bear the brunt for your decisions.
1	I’m double vaccined, got Covid a week ago, there’s no way I’d want to go through that unvaccinated
1	"I'm not an anti-vaxxer but..." says every single anti-vaxxer.
1	A medical professional who opposes vaccination violates her, his or their professional knowledge to a degree that it puts that professional competence into question! It stands to reason to ask wether that person opposes other medical standards like disinfection before medical procedures. It would be prudent to monitor such staff for adherence to prescribed medications and medical treatments of patients. There is a decisive difference between freedom of choice and harmful incompetence!
1	This makes me very happy I have a 6 and 3 year old I want them Protected accidentally myself I just haven't gotten my six-year-old done cause I don't know if his pediatrician has it
0	I will continue to allow my immune system to do its job with no experimental vaccine!
0	If we have to live on vaccines the rest of our lives we haven't beaten it. Never in history has the medical profession been so obsessed with vaccines, and never has so much money been at stake. I had two jabs and that's the last of it
0	Vaccines usually take years to safely create. We do not know the long-term effects of the covid vaccine. Nor do we know the long-term effects of covid-19. The best thing we can do is try to stay healthy, and avoid anyone who might have had contact with the virus. I understand if older people get the vaccine, but what will happen to someone 20 years from now who are in their 20s and get it? We do not know the long-term effects of the vaccine.
1	If you don’t trust science then don’t run to the people whose profession is based on science.
1	Vaccination can stop this pandemic)
1	"I don't know what's in it" but also "please give me an entire Cocktails of meds in this pretty IV here so I don't die"
1	There will always be people who do not understand the realities of public health and do not feel a responsibility to their fellow-citizens to do things they don't like for the common good. This is an "educational moment" for us all.
1	So, here in Hungary we are not going to get enough of the pfizer, I would like to get pfizer/ moderna/oxford, but as a young person(non health care) I will only be able to get sputnik. If you are starving any food is good right ?
1	The way this is headed you will likely be challenged by this virus eventually. Do you want to give your body a heads up on what's coming?
1	I miss when i would ride my bike outside for fun and shit was simpler, get your vaxx
1	I got COVID last January when I was 5 months pregnant. Landed in the ER after 8 days with shortness of breath. Gave birth two weeks early. Ended up being okay, and baby was fine, and mine was still considered a mild case. Still have taste and smell issues. I wish there had been a vaccine available to me back then. I realize this is somewhat of an echo chamber, but please. Vaccination—just consider it.
1	Get vaccinated to protect you and others and please keep wearing your mask and washing hands, you won't believe in it until someone close to you dies from it or you have it yourself like me last year, lost my sister to it, miss her every day, please take this serious.
0	Let’s stop calling it a vaccine and call it what it really is. It’s a lethal injection with delayed results
1	With the Corona vaccines, we even have the advantage that they have already been vaccinated millions of times worldwide. So that even the detection of very rare side effects has been simplified.
1	Dose three. Finally. #BoosterDose
0	Vaccine is no good!
0	Do u think is ur vaccins is what made humanity live? Hahaha funny and sarcastic
0	FRANKENSTEIN VACCINES? NO THANKS!
1	The half-wit antivaccine trolls posting here must be second-string. They can't even manage to put together a coherent sentence, much less a cogent argument. The nincompoops try to pretend they understand the science, and in doing so make even bigger fools of themselves. Anyone who sees their moronic blather should ask them just what their objectives are. Clearly, they don't give a ripe fig about the health of children and are almost certainly ignorant adolescents themselves.
1	THANK GOD COVID VACCINE has just come in time to save people. This PANDEMIC has shown us how devastating a disease can be without the Vaccines. They are like powerful reminders to control the spread of virus. Hoping for the Safety of our people in the world.
1	I’m not an expert but it might not ever end since people don’t want to get vaccinated and wear masks but it will go away mostly away I think
0	A love one believed it was safe. She's now dead. My friend also trusted covid vaccines. He now have blood clots in his eyes and need 3 sessions of surgery.
1	I got the vaccine and I am not afraid! I am doing it also for my child
0	No one can force an experimental drug into any one's body without their full consent according to the Nuremberg Code. But the US Constitution does have a provision to disband a government that no longer serves the people, and all States have the right to secede from the Union. We are a legal federation of individual states.
0	There is a bottom line here: these vaccines have killed thousands and maimed millions in the UK alone. Anyone still pushing them is guilty of negligent homicide
0	No one sticking that poison in my arm
1	I was able to repair my view towards them and am going in for my second Pfizer soon.
0	the amount of women going infertile from these vaccines makes me want to do unspeakable shit
0	HUMAN RIGHTS- WE GET TO CHOOSE WHAT WE WISH OR NOT WISH TO DO, INCLUDING VACCINES
0	Untested, unlicensed, no possibility of informed consent, unnecessary (ACDP declared covid no more dangerous than flu in March), DNA-modifying. Coerced experimental vaccines are illegal (Nuremberg code). This is fascism. Evil.
0	the vaccine does not effectively prevent Delta infection, nonetheless the drug pushers are trying to force people to inject junk science into their veins.
1	Lost a good friend to covid, 39 years old, no comorbidities. Took 6 days before his organs failed during the delta peak. Saddest part, he was in queue for his first covid vaccine.
0	Now we know everyone can get it either way and isreals study found even after the 4th dose it doesnt protect against omi No one cares . JUST DONT MADATE SOMETHING THAT DOESNT WORK
1	Injecting a man made fake vaccine into your body is just plain and simple stupidity
1	I had my moderna two doses and I'm so glad I did. My county recently had a bigger outbreak of covid (6 times the cases) and I feel so much better knowing that I'm protected and so is my family. In fact it's helped my mental health alot. I spent over a year very scared of my family getting sick so I avoided any contact with people outside my family and that led me into a form of depression. Being able to go out (with mask and distance) and feel safe has been a game changer. Oh and for anyone curious heres my side effects, 1st shot: sore arm lasted 2 days. 2nd shot: muscle ache, headache, lasted 1.5 days
0	Oh get another booster. And another one . I'm sure the boosters that only protect against the first couple strains will do fine again future variants.
1	I got the vaccine because I don’t want to die from covid-19. Even if I catch it but don’t die from it
1	Got 2 doses of Pfizer. Felt fine after bothi was a little tired for a couple days. My entire family got covid, they all chose not to get the vaccine. I ended up being the only one who didn't catch it.
1	Because idiots won’t get the shot so we can eradicate this thing once and for all
0	PLUS what happened to the science of antibodies keeping you safe afterwards? Nothing makes senseeeee
1	et the vaccine and stop telling people it is ok to not get it. The only people who shouldn't get it are the immunocompromised that their doctor says they shouldn't
0	There's a new deadly variant been discovered. Its called VACCINE
0	To fight the virus naturally. Zinc, vitamin C, working out, social distancing. I literally do not leave my house. There is no one size fits all. U can literally tell who has the vaccine by how they talk on here. It's in u. So ur baised about anything bad said against it. #COVID19
1	I'm so grateful for vaccines. And so glad that new techniques are making them more effective and faster to make!
0	People talk about choice well when you tell someone get the shot or lose your job that's not a choice that's an ultimatum.
1	just relax and keep getting your jabs 🙂
0	The extremism started with the unnecessary lockdowns and unconstitutional mask mandates. It boiled over when governments started forcing people to be injected with mystery juice.
1	The vaccine is not experimental.
1	I don't know anyone having adverse effects from the vaccines
1	Dr Robert Malone is an expert in mRNA vaccines and had both jabs of Moderna. Please follow his actions not words.
0	This is getting ridiculous More people die every year from cancer and heart disease.
1	I had astra zeneca, I’m mid 60’s and nothing happened, so perhaps people shouldn’t generalize
1	I wish all these  anti vaccers were old enough to enjoy polio
1	Due to me getting vaxxed and boosted my Covid was just me sleeping a lot. For unvaccinated people it can mean hospitalization
1	You aren’t granted immunity, you’re giving your immune system the proper intel for your body to fight it.
1	& Booster Dose done too. Plz get yourself Vaccinated today
1	a corona infection also brings with it health risks and, depending on age, these are significantly higher than those of vaccination. And those who do not get vaccinated will eventually become infected, that much is certain.
0	Who in their right mind would take this vaccine! Il wait two years and see what the side effects are like before taking it
0	The “vaccine” does NOT WORK You only get exposed to the risk of the severe side effects.
0	Pfizer is as dangerous as the others But shhhh
0	You do not know what you are injecting
0	I remember why I don't watch sky news now. I had covid in April 2020 and have not been reinfected even with my son having covid recently. I am unvaccinated so natural immunity works even almost 2 years later and with the latest variants. I respect Dr James for speaking out the truth.
0	In your opinion, is Trudeau making us a long Covid or is he really a big wimp?  (It's been 10 days since he disappeared)…
0	You get a fine if you don't commit suicide. Understand that these politicians need to die unless you want them to come for your kids next.
1	I wish we quit worrying about the handful of anti-vaxxers in rich nations and bring the vaccines where they can do the most good.
1	Finally got my first covid vaccine today. So far no tail or unicorn horn or anything exciting. Just a sore arm. Grateful for progress.
1	The evidence is becoming overwhelming. COVID-19 is linked to a much higher risk of new type 1 diabetes diagnoses in children. Type 1 diabetes is not a trivial disease — it is incurable and requires a lifetime of insulin injections.  If you need one reason to get the vaccine for your children, this is it.
0	If a jab for each variant is the path forward, the vaxxed are all gonna have the arms of a heroin addict in 2-3 years. No need for papers, just pull up your sleeves.
1	I've had several family members being in ICU because of covid. I will definietely get the vaccine!
0	Fourth?! Are there really people lining up for this madness. Wow. Just wow.
0	What it concern me the most is it lowering lymphocytes T, B (fight cancer cells) mitocondria and high level of D-Dimer (sign of thromboses).  FIFA did not find the cause of 108 player death in less than 6 months, and most collapse on the field.) All vaxxin.
0	I'd like to remind everyone that covid vaccine companies are released from liability for vaccines. You are on your own when something happens, you are the one who will bear consequences
0	A doctor testifies that health authorities blackmailed doctors to withdraw their medical licenses if they issued waivers against #COVID_19 injections. #Mafiosi #Corruption
1	I assume you would go to hospital if you break an arm, a leg or have a significant injury. You would also trust doctors with surgery - which, to be honest, is a way higher level of trust than getting advice on a drug or another. During surgery, they cut you open. One slightly wrong move and you’re gone. That’s intense. And yet you don’ trust the same people, and the same science, in regards with a simple jab that is given to everyone else. That really baffles me. 2021, and some people would still rather die than follow basic medical advice, because “they don’t trust” doctors. Neanderthal much, isn’t it…?
1	I am NOT an anti-vaxxer, but I AM against vaccine mandates. Especially since yesterday! Yesterday, I met a man who ended up in hospital for two weeks with kidney failure caused by a Covid vaccine. His kidney function went down to 15%! He ended up on a mild dose of chemotherapy, too! His kidney function has risen back up, but it is still 50% down on their normal function. So, my question is this: If vaccines are mandates, who takes responsibility when everything goes wrong?
1	The fact is, if it weren’t for these rich, advanced countries developing effective vaccines so quickly, poor, developing countries would take years to develop their own vaccine.
0	Of course we can’t blame the “vaccine” but it’s ok to  blame the dead victim.
1	we need to be careful especially unvaccinated people as they more risk to new variant pose more lethal and contagious.
1	RNA-based vaccines have been studied for more than 30 years.
1	Herd immunity is so important! Everyone should get vaccinated!
1	My arm is ready, get it out there.
0	mandatory vaccination is so dumb
1	A most worthy effort. A lot of vaccines hesitancy results from ignorance. Such advocacy would do much to overcome it. Ultimately to the benefit of those enlightened as a result.
0	When the CEO's who made the vaccine won't even take it, then I am going to question it.
1	This has never been a bigger issue than now!! Please vaccinate for yourself, your loved ones, and your whole community.
1	I got both doses last year. For the first shot, my arm was just sore for a day. The second dose was a little bit unpleasant. Had a slight fever and runny nose for a day, but after that I was alright again. Till now I haven’t gotten sick, so that’s good! Stay safe everyone!
1	I’m curious why people with all this paranoia about mRNA don’t get the J&J vaccine?
0	omicron is affecting mainly the vaccinated actually. So still be careful
1	You should say vaccinated the right vaccine though
1	They have tested the vaccine, and yes some people who have been vaccinated do get Covid but it’s usually not as bad as for people unvaccinated, unless they have a preexisting condition
1	Got my first Pfizer jab exactly 4 weeks ago.
0	How safe is it? not safe enough for me to take.
0	I got vacine I'm 16 my mom forced me I'm worried now the things that are coming out am I fine
0	Me and my family will remain unvaccinated :)
0	People don't want the vaccine because there's very credible sources saying it's not safe, and the more politicians and media who aren't trustworthy push it the more people don't want it.
0	Death is just a side effect
0	My daughter had her 1st Pfizer jab over 4 months ago. She is still suffering from side effects and has been unable to go to school. Weakness and pins and needles (especially from waist down) which made it difficult to even get out of bed at beginning. Headaches, stomachaches, backaches, heart beating fast and loudly, exhaustion and wanting to sleep all day. Drs say it’s due to an overactive immune system and there are others like this. I just wish these side effects are more talked about in media.
1	I Will happily get my third dose and every booster needed
0	And my natural element immunity is 13 times better than the vaccine so I'll pass.
1	I had my booster a few days ago!!! I feel great!! A layer of protection for myself and others. I encourage everyone to get vaccinated when it's their turn.
1	vaccine exists to help us go back to normal!
0	The CDC in the US has confirmed that natural immmunity after having Covid is nearly 5 times as effective as vaccination. A study by John Hopkins uni shows it protects for nearly 2 years
1	Get the vaccine and wear a mask. Vaccines prevent Covid 19 and even with 70% effectiveness if you get Covid it is less severe and prevents death or hospitalizations. Very effective. It is the only way to get through this pandemic. There is nothing else in the vaccine. That is how other diseases like smallpox, measles, polio have been irradicated.
1	The vaccine IS 100% safe and effective. That is 100% proven by clear statistics
0	They expect us to trust them and follow like lost sheep. Not happening! Not getting vaccinated!
0	Why the vaccine if there is no COVID?
1	the data supports vaccines being safe and effective at preventing serious illness and death.
1	Quite relieved because I got my 3rd shot of covid vaccine.
1	This makes me feel lovely, since I got an original Pfizer dose, but just boosted Saturday w/ Moderna.
1	the people who say that they would have preferred awareness campaigns rather than having the vaccine imposed on them I don't know if you've noticed but the state has been trying to raise awareness since January
0	Glad I never took the vaccine .
1	Anti-vaxxers deny themselves because they don't want to accept they're wrong.
1	Nothing to be concerned about. Its completely safe.
0	The fact that the government is hiding alot of shit aka sensoring the truth and only leaving the false information out is crazy. So many people I know have either died or had issues with the vax
1	Tested positive for covid, take care everyone! Get vaccinated
0	Plz dont take it
0	Kids get excited about video games and sweets not vaccines
0	The upcoming corona vaccine is a killer. It seems to be even more dangerous than previous shots. Since so many have a high amount of toxicity already stored in the body, the organs might not be able to handle the gredient in this #billgatesvaccine
1	I've been “fully vaccinated” for over one month and I survived it. Hard to believe, isn't it? You have to do your own research and decide for yourself whether the benefits outweigh the risks. Personally, I'd rather get the vaccine over getting CoVid any day.
0	The same clowns telling us to get vaccines are the same clowns who told us we would be underwater by now because of climate change.
1	It's interesting that they trust the doctors enough to go to the hospital to get treated but not enough to get the vaccine or even to believe that COVID exists.
0	Over 99% survival rate for anyone who isn't a 70 year old diabetic. You silly paranoid maniacs
1	I don't understand how ease of mind alone wouldn't be enough of a reason for people to get it. The science points in the right direction.
1	I'm so glad I made the right decision in getting these jabs
1	My vote is for the mRNA vaccine.
1	All I have to say is Your life your choice  Get vaccinated  that simple!!
1	The long term effects of contracting COVID are worse…perhaps death. I’ll take my chances with the vaccine. There’s a reason I never contracted measles…
0	Why should people support anything related to a vaccine that has been proven to not work. The only thing it has been good for is being used as a scare tactic and those companies manufacturing it making more money. Keep our taxes in the USA!
1	Because the vaccine was made using techniques that had been refined over a period of over 10 years and previously used to work on vaccines for things like Ebola. We just didn’t hear much about those because Ebola was contained, mostly by isolation, before widespread immunization could be rolled out. Because it was tested and passed by multiple panels of scientists with more relevant credentials than yours, mine or the person you follow on Twitter. Literally millions of people have received COVID-19 vaccine with only a very tiny minority (less than 1 in 100,000) have had a serious problem like blood clots. Headaches, body aches, sore arms and being tired for a couple of days don’t count as safety problems. They are NOTHING compared to symptomatic COVID, which at least 10% (1 in 10) of the unimmunized population has had. Because nearly all of those that have received the vaccine have not gotten symptomatic COVID-19 and only a VERY tiny number have had serious COVID-19 and been hospitalized or died. 2/3 of the people that did have severe COVID-19 after immunization had pre-existing problems with their immunity that kept them from receiving full benefit from their vaccine. (Vaccines tell your immune system how to get ready to fight the virus or bacteria they are against. If your immune system is unable to respond, either due to a rare genetic syndrome, or more likely due to a blood cancer like leukemia or immune suppressing drugs, like chemotherapy or drugs for diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, then it is the defect in the immune system’s ability to respond, not a problem with the vaccine that caused the “failure”.) Because all I really need to know that it is a at least 1000 times safer than taking my chances with COVID without it!
1	First Pfizer's is 90% effective, and now Moderna's is 95%? This is fantastic, especially with so many people wary of the vaccine. We're almost there, everyone!
0	The hatred towards the unvaccinated is only growing. Now I understand how Germans could do cruelty against other minorities..
1	I knew the cheese slice model so far only from aviation, because also there it explains very well that a catastrophe occurs only by the failure of several components. And every time a plane crashes, a new "cheese slice" is added by the appropriate authorities. But regarding vaccination, this should get much more coverage.
1	Those rejecting the vaccine because they claim to have been "born free" simply do not understand government. We have to pay taxes bitch, none of us are free
1	I got vaccinated today and it is cool
0	Well that should pretty much be a wrap on omicron then. If the vaccine can’t prevent infection and the variant is barely killing anyone, there’s essentially no point in getting a 4th.
0	Shamming me through a talk-down to the audience video. You've convinced me to NOT get the vaccine.
1	I want no part of that shit ever again, I will take whatever shots they want to give me.
0	Still not taking the vaccine tho y'all stay safe
1	Today my sister encountered an antivaxxer that said in 100 years everyone who was vaccinated will be dead.
1	95 percent of people die of Covid 19 are not vaccinated
1	By spring, Covid will have killed almost one of every three hundred Americans and people still don’t see the need to get vaccinated. A death wish.
0	Taking the vaccine in exchange for the hope on an easier progression of the illness, is like cutting off your leg to avoid athletes foot!
1	India send free Gifted vaccine to Brazil, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bolivia, combodia, Bhutan , South Africa , UAE
0	And they can shove that Vaccine into the pile of the rest I won't get
1	These  people are just just bringing up one in maybe a million case and saying that we shouldn’t get vaccinated for that!
1	if your child isn't vaccinated, then you know you did your duty as a parent!! It's your job to protect them from those that want to do harm to them. Even if that entity is your gov and greed is their motive.
0	The vaccines are ineffective you can get a shot and still get the virus and yet they insist on multiple vaccinations give it up it’s mutated down to a mild flu at this point
1	got my pfizer vaccine 2 days ago and my arm really hurt on the first day, but it's getting better. get ur vaccine yall and hope that this pandemic ends
1	I got my first dose this week, felt so good for so many reasons!
1	Booster shots for the same population over and over again doesn't solve a GLOBAL pandemic. It's an unfortunate example of insanity.
0	Doctors, nurses, highly skilled professionals, leave the country that wants to mandate those injections
0	Hmmm, New Zealand doctor, says his study finds nanotechnology in vaccines.
1	Thanks to everyone doing their civic duty and getting vaccinated. Things have been opening up for everyone to enjoy mostly thanks to you who are willing to make some personal sacrifices.
0	risks outweigh benefit.. time will tell
0	Vaccinated have to accept they've been had
0	A good friend of mine passed away from a massive heart attack the day after her second Covid shot. She was otherwise very healthy.
1	Anti-vax should be treated as terrorist cause they are. They put everyone in danger
1	Fair enough. See a lot of articles about these Pepe who don’t need the vaccine. They usually end in hospital with covid
0	I don’t feel sorry for you and others that have been vaccinated. How can a sane person willingly take a poison?
0	My wife just got off the phone with her mum. Her mum spoke to a parent whose boys attend the same school as ours. His youngest is a national level athelete who now can't run for two years after heart complications post Covid vaccination. Stop the vaccine rollout for kids!
1	Sign me up!! Where can I get it??
1	we were all blessed to be able to have access to those vaccines which prolonged lives or enhanced them!
1	I got vaccines complete thank God
1	It strenghtens the inmune system!
0	There must be a vaccine for pre natal babies too
1	Inject this into my veins and let’s end this!!!
1	Anti-vaxxers are literally the dumbest cunts in existence.
0	3 of the 6 latest deaths in my city (London, Ontario) were boosted, 1 person had 2 doses, two were unvaccinated. With only 42% boosted, and 82% with 2 doses, I think the boosted are a little over represented here in recent deaths.
1	I do not see what the big deal is.  Vaccines are always 100 percent effective and never ever have harmful side effects.
0	First time in history that the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who haven't taken it.
1	I will be fuckin pissed if we have to start wearing masks again to protect the unvaccinated.
1	Please get vaccinated!
0	Didn’t the Pfizer CEO literally say it does nothing for Omicron? These idiots are all attributing their lack of symptoms to the vaccine without realizing if they didn’t have it they would feel identical.
1	The same people who don't want to wear a mask won't get a vaccine
1	Great article! We do not just vaccinate kids to reduce the risk of mortality. We vaccinate kids to reduce the risk of morbidity.
0	I know 2 people personally (close to me) that died of covid-19. I know 4 people personally (also close to me) that died within 30 days of receiving the vaccine. I had covid, but to me symptoms were mild. I'm worried about this vaccine
1	Fully accepts modern medicine when it comes to getting a heart transplant, but rejects it when it comes to a vaccine because he doesn’t believe in it? You either trust the professionals or you don’t, you can’t have it both ways.
0	The time to prevent the damage was in the beginning. Pushing experimental vaccines and immune-system-weakening lockdown policies, if anything, increased the amount of damage inflicted. Whether it was incompetence or malice, this situation cannot be forgotten.
1	Like this post if you’re fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and proud of it!
1	I am trying to seek advice on how to convince my friend to get the vaccine, she is extremely anti vaccination because she says that they do not know "long term effects" the vaccine might have. I feel quite hopeless as I am not a doctor and have not done much research into this, however I have tried to tell her that it is far better than the alternative which is being in the middle of an epidemic like there is in India at the moment. Any advice, articles or help you could give would be GREATLY appreciated.
1	I have my appointment for Pfizer vaccine today
1	I had a few friends waiting for this - and now they are getting the Pfizer vaccine! Honestly, found many of those who were unsure were opting for the J&J, but you don’t hear a lot about that vaccine anymore. I know Pfizer is all about marketing, but it seems odd
1	Anti vaxxers are stupid beyond belief.
0	All side effects are under reported. All benefits are exaggerated. Long term risks are high.
1	My brother is a doctor, I will take the shot, it is our best chance to end this pandemic
0	I lost my love one after taking the vaccine. The choice is yours, don't regret it like me .
0	I’m not gonna be a guinea pig.
1	He's right about that but every Christian should be responsible and take the approved vaccines to save lives
1	so grateful for it that we can protect ourselves and kids from risk of death and long covid issues.
0	Anyone with any sense has at least some hesitation. We're talking about a drug that was rushed through, and treats a disease with a 99% susrvival rate
1	Finally!
1	Just got my first shot yesterday. Holy fuck I feel terrible today
0	No more vaccines / boosters
1	I do feel like Squidward in picture number 5 because I got my booster vaccine today.
1	I think there are people who got a first dose of the rna vax had a problem and were unable to complete the series. It sounds like the world needs this vaccine because of it's efficacy and easier refrigeration requirements .
0	Natural immunity was always clear a better system to health than healing with vaccines.
1	you know why covid doesn’t scare me? Because I got the vaccine as soon as I could
1	I just got vaccinated
0	When you silence a man, you don't prove him wrong, you only admit you feared what he had to say
0	Imagine getting four vaccines shot in 1 year and calling unvaccinated crazy
1	In 6 months our entire healthcare system is going to crash as doctors and nurses who complied fall extremely ill. People I know who were Vaxxed in March are now becoming incredibly sick with autoimmune disorders and more. Go get whatever you’ve been putting off done, now.
0	The Vaccine doesn't work, the virus is a cold to flu range so its bad for elderly and vulnerable, we've been lied to, the bigger picture is damming to our freedom and rights.
1	Thanks John. Once again, you are quite welcome on a screen in my home today. => Glad to see the great vaccine news and Penny’s reports. => One can take this data on a vaccine decrease efficacy and eating the decrease for the other vaccines. Still well worthwhile. Would have been approved with this lower, estimated lower efficacy. => Thanks again John for all you do and who you are.
0	the most vaccinated country have the most cases and the less vaccinated the less cases!!!a total rip off who make peoples sick!!
0	The safest way is to boost immune system through recognized/,proven natural foods and healthy lifestyles.Altering the natural body system definitely has side effects.
1	Please approve it ASAP people have been waiting for this vaccine
0	Imagine thinking you should FORCE people to get a “vaccine” that blatantly doesn’t work. Statistically Trudeau would have been fine regardless of a vaccine and we all know that at this point. This is disgusting.
1	Yeah, I'm wondering why there are so few doses available already. Wasn't "Warp Speed" supposed to be about manufacturing doses prior to approval? It seems like they should have been able to produce much more than what they have so far.
1	I’m alive and fine. It works. I understand being weary but these vaccines have been distributed to millions upon millions. Across the world. Yet finding the random cases that go bad to make a narrative is gross. We’d be in a whole new pandemic if all the fear mongering was true
0	If you think that this is normal or good for society, then you're part of the problem! Once they can force you to get it against your will, they can do whatever they want to you and your family using all kinds of pretexts!
0	not a fuckin chance I will ever vaccinate my kids for this shit
1	Woah woah woah. Let’s just do our part to stop the pandemic. That includes vaccination.
0	This is sickening. No to vaccine.
1	if you’re drinking mcdonald’s coffee you should not be worried about what’s in the vaccine
1	Trust science!
1	We vaccinated over 300 elders and staff at my work in January. No issues for anyone.
1	To avoid the vaccines because of the small chance of side effects is like avoiding food due to the risk of getting salmonella. Yeah, the risk is there but the probability is low.
1	I understand parents wanting the most information possible before making a choice for their kid. I understand wanting to talk to a doctor about risk before making that choice. I understand parents wanting to push for even better vaccines with even less risk and even more research. But it blows my mind that people are so worried about the small chance of an adverse reaction that they’d put their kids at risk for dangerous and preventable diseases
0	Because it doesn’t even meet the true definition of Vaccine. It is ineffective and it is not safe for some people.  I have had Covid, I required no treatment and was just fine in a few days. The immunity that I already have is better, stronger and longer lasting than the ‘vaccine’ will give me anyway, and I didn’t risk my life to get it.  I hear there is a shortage of vaccines, they can give mine to anyone else who wants it.
1	I got the Pfizer shots. I felt a cold rush go through my entire body. Then, could taste the flavor of antifreeze. I too felt a little high. Then, 3 days, I felt sick. It was like the flu. The injection site was a hard, sore knot. The 2nd shot again, a hard sore knot. No other side effects.
0	I’ll take the risk on my natural immunity thank you
0	Tell me how putting DNA or mRNA into our bodies help?? Makes absolutely no sense.
0	My mom said her friends took it and some of them had seizures. I don’t think I am taking it.
1	Today morning I took my first vaccine dose under 18 to 44 age group, for the prevention of covid19 virus.My hand is paining now and after few hours of vaccination I am feeling ill. I AM FEELING SAFE NOW AND WAITING FOR MY SECOND DOSE. Vaccination center mumbai hospital.
0	Grats, you are vaccinated now.. At least the NCAA and Science agree with you. The vaccine is a sham.
1	Fun fact: US military service members have to get a minimum of 9 vaccines. There are an additional 8 that are required depending on deployment or job. 17 total. But let’s freak out about the Covid poke.
1	Took the 17 year old for his booster yesterday……so quiet Crying face Please get your jabs!
0	When will everyone realize this is about C O N T R O L.
0	Why is no one talking about the 12 year old girl who was left brain damaged wheelchair bound and required a feeding tube after her second shot?
0	I did not and will not receive any injection because the evidence to the contrary of it being safe and effective is too compelling.
0	I’m proud to be NOT vaccinated and proud to have that right over my own body and not fall victim to the propaganda, BS and lies! Vaccines are harming 1000s of people.
0	NO TO COVID VACCINES!!! SAVE OUR HUMANITIES !!!
0	This morning appointment with a doctor...he asks me《are you vaccinated?》I tell him NO… He tells me 《Bravo hold on...we are going to win...》I thought I was going to cry with joy,
0	I'm not anti-vax or anything, but I had COVID and those side effects sound worse than the virus itself, as most people have mild symptoms like I did
1	So, at the beginning of the pandemic, with no vaccine, these covidiots screwed everyone over by refusing to mask/quarantine/social distance. Now that there's a vaccine, they're making things even worse becoming breeding grounds for new variants
1	Right if we want to end pandemic all people have to get vaccine both dose
1	Getting vaccinated is like wearing a seatbelt in a car. Doesn't mean you won't get hurt in an accident, but decreases your chance of dying.
0	I am a 68 year old man whoI think has fought off both main COVID variants without the vaccine or medical care.  It seems to me that I am better off having a successful natural response to the disease than artificial one.
1	Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 can lower your risk of getting and spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Vaccines can also help prevent serious illness and death.
0	My son’s girlfriend got her second Moderna vaccine today and she’s sick with a fever... she feels like she has Covid again.
1	I’d rather put on a mask than be put on a ventilator ANYDAY!!! Protests signs in the back: “I can’t breathe” , yes you can hunny…
0	If it is supposedly harmless then why did my sister almost die after getting vaxed?
1	The pandemic would go away if everyone would get vaccinated!
0	The reason why I’m not getting vaccine is because I’ve had family members get it and STILL get covid. Also it is literally a test to put on people. We are just experiment and I would rather not get something that I don’t know fully works which obviously it doesn’t.
0	So, I was wanting zombies from this virus. Maybe they'll come from the vaccine.
0	we cant vaccinate our way outta this.
0	I just want to know why we have to wear masks if the vaccine works?
0	That’s what happens when you try to force people to get a vaccine through mandates or monetary incentives. Vaccines that work sell themselves you jackasses.
1	Got both shots, and am too. I do the same when it comes to Flu season. Though this was to protect myself and my family.
1	As a Texan myself, I'd like to state my apparently very controversial opinion that I'd rather have slight government intervention than a disease that could've been wiped out decades ago.
0	I am going to let others take the vaccine first and then wait, see what happens to them. Only then i will take the vaccine because I don't trust the government and nor the people they surround themselves with.
1	I advocate for vaccination while acknowledging the properties of natural immunity
0	Why would we debate vaccines? Remember, the science is settled. We don’t need to question lord pfauci and his holy juice. Safe and effective! Safe and effective! You can’t catch covid if you get these vaccines! All you people sounds like anti vaxx plague rat scum. Stop killing gramdmas!
0	The jabbed are super spreader's.
1	Yes, there's around 1% breakthrough infections of vaccinated people. However, because they're vaccinated, they don't usually end up dead.
1	I dont care whats in it, I need to hit the dance floor again
0	Vaxx pushers are evil, pure evil.
1	Just got my first does of vaccine at my local walgreens. I didn't feel any pain, just a little warm
0	Unvacincated and staying Unvacincated My choice My body
1	Really? Nobody should lose their job if they refuse to "inject their body"? So she'd be fine with a midwife that didn't have the MMR vaccine?
0	It has not been tested
1	A vaccinated person can heave a big sigh of relief for the reason that at least for a year he can be free from getting infected. He/she would feel and experience a big burden getting off-loaded. This feeling is infectious as others too get a confidence, a boost and need not be worried or bothered about close interactions or indulging in activities with such persons. This way the spread can be put on a right leash. A stitch in time saves nine.
0	After a long time of supporting the vaccines after my younger brother showed me statistics that show it actually can have really bad side effects .
0	This smugness we saw from the vaccine crowd a few months ago is long gone.
0	‘I personally don’t know of anyone who’s had a bad reaction to vaccines… except for the person with headaches for 10 days and the lady who was nauseous for 3 weeks…’oh, and the kid that developed myocafditis
1	Then tell people to get vaccinated!
1	my family got vaccinated with Pfizer, Moderna and Jensen and we are all ok
0	Safe! How would they know? How long has it been tested? How will it be stored properly? What are the long term effect? There is absolute zero way to know any of this.
1	The unvaccinated are monopolizing ICU beds and medical resources that should go to more deserving patients, they're costing the community a fortune, and they're dragging us down economically by preventing key sectors from reopening for instance international tourism, and they're endangering themselves and us all. We need more mandates like NYC where you have to show proof of vaccination to enter public places.
0	Right thing is protecting yourself by not accepting poison
1	Who else got their vaccine? Just got first shot of Moderna!
0	Imagine making an experimental vaccine mandatory. Something really shady is going on amd we can all feel it.
0	The shear fact that they are withholding the numbers of those suffering side effects tells it's own story surely! Why is this being allowed to continue?
1	I would rather have the Vaccines, & happily be above ground, than below the ground. Get Vaccinated, Please Folks.
1	2nd dose to the world! #vaccinated #readytotouchthestreets
1	My step mother is on a ventilator right now and probably gonna die. Un vaxxed and 62. Just a tragedy
0	Well, the vaccines are clearly safe. Great , when the companies state that they will be liable for all deaths ,myocarditis and other injuries then I will get mine.
0	Bill Gates admits the vaccine will no doubt kill 700000 people. The virus so far has killed 300000 globally. Can anyone explain to me why you would take a vaccine that kills more people than the virus it's designed to cure?
1	I have had a bad reaction to a vaccine before but thankfully I was able to get better. I have Multiple Sclerosis, I was diagnosed with it when I was 11 an I'm unable to have Live vaccinations I guess, i was told this when i was very young. I'm not a Anti Vaxxer I'm for Vaccines.
1	The vaccine is not a force field - it shows your immune system a picture of the virus so your body knows quickly that it is dangerous and should be attacked if seen.
0	No! Not necessary to vaccinate young kids.
1	I've taken it myself but forcing it is utter tyranny!!!
0	No healthy person needs it
0	Thank you. It is always nice to see yet another person admitting how few arguments there are for vaccinating against the coronavirus, and how most of those amount to threats to spread minor misery around... ;)
1	One jab=one step closer to herd immunity. Doesn't matter whose arm it is.
0	i wonder how humans survived before vaccines existed... Oh wait. Immune systems were around back then!
1	Please get vaccinated and safe yourself and others.
1	Thank you, Rachel. I got the vaccine because I couldn’t carelessly cause someone harm. Whether it was a friend, family, or someone I disagree with or even dislike. Getting vaccinated shows a cohesion as Canadians to do the right thing.
1	It is and the vaccine is very safe. It's a dumb decision.
1	I can't wait to take the vaccine against covid-19 and everybody around the world.
0	NONE OF THE VACCINES HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH STOPPING COVID.   PLEASE PROVE ME WRONG!!!
1	The antivaxxers don't like facts. They ignore the inconvenient truth that the majority of ICU beds are occupied by the unjabbed and still think they are right even though 90% have had at least one vaccine and they are in a minority of just afew percent.
1	Also. If you are eligible, PLEASE get vaccinated!
1	" just because I don't have dr in front of my name doesn't mean that my opinion is less valid"  yes, it does, actually.
0	If you had 2 shots. And a booster. And you still get covid 19. Does the vaccine really work?
0	Say no to Junk experimental vaccine
0	3 people I know have been hospitalised after the second and third injection. 1 clot. 1 stroke and 1 heart attack. It’s absolutely devastating!
0	Regarding vaccines :  Why do the PROTECTED need to be PROTECTED from the UNPROTECTED by covertly forcing the UNPROTECTED to use the PROTECTION that did not PROTECT the PROTECTED in the first place?? Why are there so many infections and deaths amongst those vaccinated?
0	THE GREAT AWAKENING IS HAPPENING THROUGH CHAOS. BY NOW HUMANS HAVE LEARNT THEIR LESSONS I HOPE.
0	It's not safe exactly! It's still expiremental vaccine
0	Vaccines that can uncontrollably change the DNA will never get close to me or my family…
0	No pandemic, no vaccine !!!
1	52 people died from Covid in New South Wales in the past 24 hours, 52 people is the total amount to die thus far in Aotearoa. The pandemic is not over as much as anyone wants to say it is. Please get vaccinated because Omicron is going to wash over us & you need protection.
1	All the shit people put in their bodies, but you're concerned about vaccines? Do you have any idea what is in the air you inhale into your lungs? This has nothing to do with unknowns and potential dangers. You are all fucking liars. This is childish defiance. Nothing more.
0	Maybe you should interview every vaccinated person that has side effects instead of just one. That way, we all have a better understanding of the multiple side effects that can occur from all the vaccines. Then you will get peoples attention.
1	Sign me up for that
0	In other words, he'd probably still be living had he not gotten the vaccination.
1	It is very well tested. I assume you went to school sometime. You got vaccinated. you get this one for the same reasons so that everyone is not constantly giving it to each other. Get vaccinated. End of convo.
1	Anti vaxxers having another bad week
1	I received my first Pfizer shot about 60 hours ago.  NO fever; NO headache, NO lethargy.  The injection site in my arm began to hurt about 6 hours after I had the shot.  The pain was manageable without ibuprofen or aspirin.  By the second day the pain began to fade and late in the afternoon it just disappeared.  I worked out today and feel fine.  From what I've read the second shot probably won't go as easily.  However, at 70 years old I figure the reward far outweighs the risk.
1	It will be a cold day in hell before my granddaughters take this poison.
1	I really fucking hate that we have to waste resources on studies that are 100% unnecessary just because some people came up with an excuse to not get the jab. And then the icing on the shit cake is it won't change their minds anyway, they'll just find something else.
0	Not gonna take it.
1	I keep seeing really stupid memes on my feeds saying "if it doesn't prevent Covid-19, why are we getting vaccinated". This is why. It prevents death, it works.
1	Plenty of vaccines already are more than two doses and they recommend boosters regularly. Vaccination is safe
0	I got Covid-19 in May 2020. Never took the jab and don’t plan too. Been fine ever since. And so has my wife and 3 boys
0	In my country we have all kinds of vaccines but no one wants to get it
0	You can take that vaccine and shove it... This is just an advertisement for pharmaceutical companies. Their track record in the past with dangerous drugs hasn't been good at all.
0	I would like to know how you know that the vaccine makes you less likely to go to hospital, what proof is there?
0	This vaccine has also made women infertile. And tell me there’s not enough proof to prove it’s the vaccine. But what proof is there to say it isn’t ?
0	Don't think I'm getting the vaccine... Covid vs vaccine - Both will make you sick.. - Both will create anti bodies in you - Both ways you will still pass covid to those around you
1	I love me jabs... Keep em coming!
1	The importance of #vaccination can also be seen when looking at other indicators. One third of deaths among 0-19 year olds since March 2020 occurred in this month, a level well above other, better vaccinated age groups.
1	I appreciate that you guys are just spreading information and incentivizing the vaccine and not advocating for mandates
1	In Eastern countries, we always believe that vaccines protects us from getting terrible diseases, and I can't figure out why some people in other countries against vaccines.
1	Just got pfizer nothing at all feeling great!! No effects no sore arm
1	Many people get this question wrong. Whether the vaccine is safe isn’t the point. The delta variant of covid is highly contagious. You either get the vaccine or you risk getting covid. Having covid is much more dangerous than the low chance of an issue with a vaccine. I just had my first covid jab yesterday. Sure it sucked. I hate needles which makes it worse. And right after, I didn’t feel that great. But my friend who got covid nearly died. He was one step from being on a ventilator. Still to this day he has breathing issues. It’s simply not worth it.
0	My county just reported its first omicron case. The fellow who got it had the vaccination and the booster. So, there’s that. Also, regardless of people’s vaccination status, viruses will continue to mutate. One cannot blame the nature of a virus on those who are not vaccinated.
1	I have tachycardia and other health issues and I wasn't worried about the vaccine at all. COVID is so much more dangerous to your heart.
1	If I remember the original study, the authors were making the claim that since the vaccine gives some people a headache and since neurological disorders can include headaches, then the vaccine must cause neurological disorders. It was the dumbest sort of non scientific conclusion. It was authored by a guy trying to sell alternative medicine treatments, a known antivaxer and a dentist. Brilliant.
0	I took the vaccine yesterday and I got the worst migraine of my life today. The night followig the vaccination I felt chills the whole night and was freezing even with two thick hoodies on. I regret taking it so fkn much as I was completely fine before and I never got sick with covid these last 2 years
0	I'm not a anti vaxxer or anything but how quickly they came out with it is worrisome. I have multiple anxiety disorders that make me more scared than the average person but I think I have a right to be scared everyone has a right to be scared. It's the unknown that frightens me. I'm scared of covid and I'm scared of the shot. Us anxiety folks are royally screwed
0	I would NEVER take a pill to extend by life beyond natural ability for the same reasons I refuse to shoot their experimental injection into my veins
1	I’m fully vaccinated and was diagnosed today, I can’t taste but I can smell. I feel exhausted and I’m congested with a light cough. Not the greatest of feelings but I’m glad I got the vaccine because I can’t imagine how I’d be feeling if I hadn’t gotten it.
0	I’m just an observer sitting here watching those participating in this great human experiment wondering just how many jabs they’ll continue to inject until they reach their oh shit moment that something is clearly not right
1	She should be EXPELLED from nursing school if she doesn't believe in vaccination!😡
0	Some people really prefer to get shots that make you sick every 4 mos?
1	Mfs being scared of a microchip tracking them in their body when they carry a phone that's prone to being hacked on them 24/7
1	don't be in denial, the vaccine is safe
0	I listen to facts and science...you go with yer feelings bud. Do you want me to send a nurse or doctor to tell you that most of the unvaccinated are in the ICU now?
1	Yeah it will help vaccine hesitant people while they watch the vaccinated wear masks …. Awesome , I’m so glad I got vaccinated so I can be forced to act like it didn’t matter , while everyone says it was a good idea
1	I serach this video : importance of vaccination in this lockdown (covide-19)
1	Imagine after almost 10 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered worldwide, subsequently saving millions of lives, you decide it is appropriate to say you wish they didn’t exist. I’ll continue to work and improve these vaccines to save others. What will YOU do?
1	got my pfizer vaccine 2 days ago and my arm really hurt on the first day, but it's getting better. get ur vaccine yall and hope that this pandemic ends
1	My mother refused to get the vaccines, later one of my uncles died 'cause of Covid and she realized it was THAT SERIOUS, so she got vaccinated and is wearing her mask properly. XOXO
0	Keep falling for their lies i am not getting vaccinated
1	Why is @FoxNews  continuing to broadcast dangerously false information about the COVID vaccine? Every family member of a person who watches the network and dies after refusing to be vaccinated should sue them.
1	If they're scared of a little needle and unwilling to obey those above them, then they're not good sailors anyway.
1	I’ve been hearing from a lot of folks out there telling me they are on the fence about getting the Covid vaccine. They ask me “Hill, are you doing it?” If you’ve already gotten your shot(s) great! And if you are on the fence check out this video as remember there are millions of people around the world that died lonely and painful deaths from Covid. Each and every one of them would trade places with us in an instant to have the opportunity to get vaccinated. And you are not only helping to protect yourself but also helping to protect others by reducing spread. And lastly, thank you so much to all of our frontline healthcare workers! I’m proud to have the opportunity to play one on our show and thank you for all the work you’ve done to save lives and keep people safe.
1	Yes, chicken pox is very bad if you get it as an adult, which is why before there was a vaccine people would intentionally have their kids get it. There's a small risk to kids too, but that's much better than getting in as an adult, so you would roll the dice!
0	You can still get covid if you get the vaccine and the boosters, dude. Plus, if you're healthy, young and have no comorbidities what's the point in getting the jabs? It's really insane that they approved this experimental jab for kids now. But I'm sure you think it's just fine and dandy.
0	The COVID vaccine is like a tattoo…. That you can never remove ha ha h
1	I'm almost 50. got two Pfizer and one booster from Moderna. I went to gym 4 times a week and play basketball there. never caught the virus. With the contacts I have daily, I believe the vaccine worked.
0	I'm not taking it
1	My dad is high risk and got the first of two covid shots, he's getting his second one today and he has felt completely fine.
1	It really frustrates me that the antivaxxers got way more time to speak and just ignored literally everything the doctor said
0	Garbage vacccines is the only reason we’re still here
0	if vaccines work so well, why do big pharma need immunity from lawsuits?
1	183 Covid+ inpatients. This is difficult and so many are confused and misinformed and it is costing them their lives. We are so sorry. 24 unvaccinated patients have died at Cox in the last 7 days and 73 in January. All would have likely survived with a vaccine.
1	All should be vaccinated unless a real health issue prohibits it.
1	I’ll take the risk of the jab rather then the risk of being hospitalised with covid
1	My entire family is vaccinated, we are doing well.
0	What is this strange feeling I’m feeling? Is it hope?!
1	God sent him vaccines but he choose not to take them. Sad.
1	Can we all agree to take it?
1	Freedom is great. Spreading vaccine misinformation and dying from covid is bad.'
1	Y’all take it first. I’ll wait to see if people turn into zombies or controlled population. If not, I’m all in.
0	I will continue walking in faith. I lost my job as a social worker for declining the vaccine.
0	Ya I've just had my first dose and I'm still scared of the exact same thing as you,  i mean a vaccine should be tested for at least 5 years,  and this came out fast,  o well too late now,  for me anyway,
0	Your chance of death from the vaccine is the same as from the virus. So I will take my chance with the virus.
1	I'm glad that Novavax included so many over 65 in their trial, as this is a vulnerable group that will especially want a vaccine. Having good data on the efficacy and safety for this group seems particularly important.
1	I got my second dose of Moderna yesterday morning and I feel perfectly fine
1	I have had 3 Pfizer vaccines now, no complaints at all. Happy Christmas
1	vaccines rock!!
1	I’d rather have minor allergies from the vaccine than have covid
0	Imagine taking 3 ineffective vaccines and blaming those who didn't
0	You can die from it but don’t be scared to get it ! So reassuring
1	I love going through the comments. Whenever someone tries to debunk the myths the comment section is full of people saying "paid by big pharma". Its hilarious. Big pharma must have the worlds biggest payroll. It must be exhausting getting every doctor to keep their mouths shut about the great reset.
1	The vaccine is spreading 10x faster than the virus. Just waiting for me to catch it. The vaccine, not the virus.
0	I’ll wait for a different vaccine
1	That's a strange way of saying we met our 70% vaccination rate. Great work everyone; time to open the country back up.
1	Get out of fake chat groups, read a quality newspaper again, what else can you advise?
0	They trippin! My kid ain’t getting one. I’ll easily pull him out of Public school. That simple.
1	My husband and I got the Pfizer vaccine and I would do it again in a heartbeat!! We had no side affects at all. So happy I got it!!!
1	We all should be grateful for having a vaccine in record time but also be realistic about the risk that may come with it.
1	Best vaccine. Had two jabs and no side effects
0	I'm super sure I'm not getting another shot.
1	Get Your Vaccine !!
0	I got my second shot. I’m sick af and very very very upset about it and wish I didn’t get it. My immune system wasn’t ever weak. I got H1N1 and I felt worse than I feel now, but I never needed a vaccine for it.
1	Vaccination is a very good way to avoid Corona. Keeping in view the epidemic of COVID, one more Humanitarian Act has been added by Dera Sacha Sauda organisation that is wear masks and inspire others to wear them too
1	I hope everyone is staying healthy, covid has been tough on everyone, let’s fight back, get vaccinated, look after our health and stay happy and warm for those 7 men who love us so fcking much.
0	vaccine my ass
0	It's not stopping people catching or spreading it, so think IL pass
0	I always ALWAYS ask if my waiter or waitress is vaccinated. THAT will decide if they get a tip or not. If they ARE VACCINATED... NO TIP. If they are NOT VACCINATED... I give them at least 5% tip!
0	Still won't take the poison!
0	but could you please explain why individuals with natural immunity still need to be vaccinated?
1	Mandate the COVID vaccine now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	Because they know its poison
1	The information in this video is from the CDC and from the data obtained by the large clinical trials based on both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. And yes, these vaccines were shown to cut viral transmission.
1	Vaccinated RN here, but I stand with you! I chose to get the vaccine, everyone should have the choice!
0	My college already got third vaccines shots and still got covid-19 two weeks ago. My doctor got his third covid-19 vaccine shots, his eyes and his voices blurred- not normal anymore.
0	What a wrong decision. Greece should have learned a lesson from Israel. Most covid patients there have been fully vaccinated. Vax is not the answer. Get med if you are not well, not vax.
1	GROWN UPS IF YOU CAN MEDICALLY GET VACCINATED DO IT FOR THE KIDS, CAUSE SOME KIDS CAN'T AND THEY ARE SERIOUSLY GETTING ILL AND IT IS NOT FAIR TO THEM.
0	This is well-planned mass-controll experiment, with the vaccine as the final straw. We need to act swiftly against this!
1	It's great seeing teens going against their anti-vaxx parents to make sure that they are safe
0	covid is just a hoax, it's the seasonal flu that we always had since forever,
0	Pls don't put vaccine on the nurse and doctors put vaccine first on ppl so if something happens and it's not good so doctors can help ppl
0	Allow a maturing immune system to naturally strive. What's wrong with those demons.
0	You can tell me I am selfish. I am not, it's purely personal medical decision.
1	I've stopped trying to have conversations with anti vaxxers in real life. But at what point do they realize they've been hoodwinked? I get people who signed up and decide this is not the life they want and use this as a get out of the military free card. But the people who genuinely think they are making a principled choice baffle me. There have been billions of vaccines given out with very little problems and tremendous positives. Perhaps when covid is over and they get it in a year or two when there is a flair up?
0	Something that is safe shouldn’t be mandatory. Wakeup people
0	The globalists thought we would all just kneel over and die in the face of the Great Reset. They saw so many lining up like cattle with their double masks on to be injected with some foreign goo. It was all going according to plan, until it wasn't. HONK HONK
1	Thank you for these outcomes, they are very easy to understand. I hope more people take vaccination more into consideration.
1	My sister was fully vaccinated, she’s just recovering from covid, I truly believe she would’ve been hospitalised if it wasn’t for the vaccine!
0	Vaccines cause autism
0	People who have a condition or are taking medications that weaken their immune system may not be completely protected even if they have completed a primary series of a COVID-19 vaccine.
1	Dude the vaccines WORK. 99% of people in the hospital from covid got that way because they did not take the vaccine.
1	There are definitely issues regarding vaccines, or more appropriately, the corporations that own the rights to them, but there's no reason an anarchist should be anti-vax that I can think of. Hell, even as a vegan, I'm pro-vax.
1	Don’t trust the medical establishment with the vaccine? Then don’t trust the hospital when you get COVID.
0	Had no cold before since i was not vaccinated but after i got vaccinated almost 2 months cold is never gone...sad to say regret is too late ....my advice ..no to vaccine
0	I won’t be taking any coronavirus vaccine
0	When has the government ever been trustworthy ?
0	There is no way of proving an individual will get less sick from COVID with a vaccination.
1	I am vaccinated and not dead.
1	I was vaccine hesitant and because of you I have ended up getting the shots. My wife and a lot of my friends aren't impressed with my decision to do so and they think I will not be around in 3 years. You seem to make sense to me. Thanks
0	Ill take my 98% survival rate over a new 1st round of experimental vaccine
0	How could they possibly have enough data ???
0	Anti-Science Fascism. Natural Immunity is the best protection, and all medical studies show it, the Harvard Medical Study, the Neuro-Immunology Study by Innsbruck University, the CDC Study, and the latest Study from Italy itself, in Umbria, which shows lasting effective NI at 18 months. Meanwhile, the Adverse Effects and evidence of Immuno-compromise caused by the Jabs continues to grow. These countries are ignoring Science and the Nuremburg Code, and they are doing it for cynical purposes, to print Pandemic Bonds to increase their Budgets. Absolutely disgusting.
0	Sooooo wrong. Forceful experimentation goes against all codes of ethics, a human rights violation.
0	My body my right I'm refusing the vaccine
0	If we have vaccinated people catching Covid, hospitalised with Covid and dying from Covid...we don't have a vaccine.
0	It takes years and sometimes decade's to get it right. I think this one is a dangerous one.
1	No excuse for not getting vaccinated
1	Leave me alone with the vaccine nonsense. I believe in  science I trust  the doctors I trust the scientists. also forget a chip I would let them put an entire IPhone next to my heart if it means I will no longer be a threat to my moms life every time I leave the house
0	The shots are the rear problem not the solution. Way to many side effects
0	We don't need other garbage to injet in our body, stop this vaccines.
1	Incredible video. Literally just turned me pro vaccine, 100% brother
0	Remember saying you’ll need a booster shot year after year was labeled “misinformation”
1	We have far more selfish and undereducated people unwilling to get vaccinated, despite their pre-existing conditions.
0	Because it is codified in the US code of federal regulations that you cannot question the safety of vaccines whether or not the claim is well founded as of 1984.
0	No thanks im chill without the vaccine
1	I can't even imagine the amount of patience some of these medical professionals have to have with these patients
0	This is both funny and sad, it’s really weird how people just keep saying “get vaccinated”.. even on msnbc, it’s like who are they talking to? The viewers? Every sick person I know is vaccinated, it’s like the biggest bamboozle ever.
0	The internet says that you can still catch and infect someone with Covid even if your vaccinated. Why get vaccinated if your gonna catch it anyways.
1	“The Kool aid only works, if everyone drinks it.” - Jim Jones 1978
0	I don’t worry about getting sick. I don’t smoke, I don’t drink, I try to run each day, stay healthy, eat good.
0	america's covid-19 vaccine rollout is leaving behind people with cystic fibrosis and other rare diseases.
0	I read so much about it and saw many documentaries and also checked everything that’s in those vaccines and I just don’t feel safe in any way to take it
0	When nurses are willing to lose their job over not taking the vaccine I know it’s not safe. By now you should know you cannot trust the government, pharmaceutical companies, and the FDA.
1	we can win against Corona virus if vaccinated
0	Scientific proof that they work? Israel has the high deaths per capita and highest vaccination rates. What science u guys doing lol
1	is it bad I put no second thought into getting my vaccine? I literally heard that a local hospital had extra vaccines and were open to the general public, and signed up for my vaccine. Waited in line for two hours to get my first dose, and felt totally normal... what the hell is wrong with these people that are freaking out about it?? what the hell are they reading/hearing??
1	Notice how the people who r pro-vaccine are all properly educated and the people who are skeptics aren’t lmao
1	Vaccinate for covid please
0	Science shows that more people die from the vaccine than covid.
0	A new study suggests that most COVID symptoms are caused by mass hysteria.
0	I like how they make the vaccine sound like it's good
1	Just let nature take it's course. When they require hospitalization...they should not get priority over those who got vaccinated....
1	the problem now is that the unvaxxed are creating a training ground that the virus can use to create more resistant strains. It's a bit like trying to stave off a meth comedown with more meth. It's not gonna go well.
1	Doesn't seem right for those so young, I'm vaxed up, but not sure about the little ones, there should be more time allowed, don't let the big companies go on making billions until we know.
1	This vaccine should be mandatory those who don’t wish to have it should be fined or have to be in permanent lockdown simple really
1	Covid isn't over more people are dying than ever.  Just get vaccinated....
1	I just got the vaccine the night before and feel awful. But I know science and my body are doing this on purpose
0	I believe the people not trying to control others through a vaccine passport.
0	The biggest question is, why are you trying to force something on me I don't want?
1	When will you roll out the 3rd booster shots for 15 to 17 year olds so I can take it?
0	How much money are they making! They should donate it to the people with adverse reactions to it.
0	One death as a result of covid is too many. One death as a result of the vaccine is an acceptable statistic. What a backwards, brainwashed world this has become.
0	How can they find a vaccine for this, but not for cancer or aids etc. And also so quickly?!?! Makes me question everything
1	Since when are PUBLIC schools not allowed to have vaccine mandates? Kids ate vaccinated against polio, diphtheria, tetanus, measles, pertussis, the list goes on. Servicemen MUST be vaccinated against a whole host of other diseases. What is wrong with these people? Have they ever seen someone die from mallpox? No, they haven't. You know why? BECAUSE OF VACCINES. God, the ignorance and complacency is mind boggling.
1	I wish more people would watch this and understand that this is not poison this is not going to change your RNA. So many people don't understand science
0	Not anyone. Only those who are vaccinated. Unvaccinated are safe.
0	I am 100% pro-vac for everything but the COVID shots. My sister got the moderna when she was 8 months pregnant. The baby was completely healthy before hand, then a week later after having nasty symptoms after getting the shot, the baby had heart failure inside her. It was completely rare, and no one blamed the shot. And when i got the second one I also had nasty side effects for 2 weeks. Don’t trust them enough for it to be good for us.
0	I'll take my natural immunity over a vaccine any day
1	Everyone ages 12 years and older should get a COVID-19 booster shot. Learn more about booster shots.
1	if the virus had a 99.997% recovery rate and there are 300k deaths, then the USA population would have 10 billion people
1	Yes! Everyone should get the vaccine so they can't spread the virus or contract it themselves!
0	#COVID19 #COVID19Vaccine Here you go. Scary, scary data for those who got the jab...
1	Sky is blue, science is clear, and COVID-19 Vaccines Work!!!
1	It will never go away as long as one Anti-Vaxxer is roaming free spreading it.
1	They have literally been proven safe. MRNA vaccines have been tested on humans for decades and its astonishing to me that so many normal, un-qualified people with no education in virology or vaccine science act like they know more than actual scientists who get paid to study this stuff.
0	My body my choice that is my decision.
0	My hypothesis is vaccines are causing a larger percentage of excess death than is being considered currently. You have in no way disproved this.  With the makers 100% indemnified and claims of damage to be paid by our gov
0	As someone with autoimmune diseases I am concerned about the risk of getting endless boosters since the last thing I need are MORE autoimmune issues. I've had three vaccines and I still got omicron so I think I'm done with the vaccines.
0	I will wait until see all effects on people, good luck
0	Question: So if my dog gets vaccinated for rabies, and 3 weeks later ends up with "BREAKTHROUGH rabies", is it better that he bites me with the vaccine or without the vaccine? Asking for a friend.
0	I'm gonna wait a year or two because that vaccine was rushed and has to many problems right I and in all honesty would rather wait until it's been approved
1	I don't want to be the reason for someone's grandma to get covid and die.
0	Well we don't vaccinate due to the vaccine inserts the majority of them list death and so on
0	COVID-19 vaccines cause mutatation and variants. Stay clear!
1	get a booster shot after completing their COVID-19 vaccination primary series.
1	Just got my vaccine today! Feeling really good and happy. Stay safe everyone <3
0	Nobody needs the covid vaccine or boosters
0	incredible how far they can go with the lack of scruples and the most basic common sense. I still hope for a day of judgment, in which even those hospital directors, accomplices to this dictatorial theater, will be condemned and banned from their right to practice medicine.
0	Please explain again how the science proves that these therapies offer BETTER protection vs. contracting C19 and fully recovering. Why does the “science” give the vaxxed superior protection over? Aren’t all antibodies the same?!?!?!??
1	I trust it is safe because I've had both shots with absolutely no reaction at all!  It was absolutely easy peasy.  I have absolutely NO doubts!
0	Because the vaccine isn’t made to keep you “safe” my friend. They don’t care about your health or wealth.
0	what is wrong with her head? she got the vaccine?
0	So sorry for children these days
0	idk how people got suckered into covid vacines, prolly because they had nothing else to offer, then they became a self fullfilling prophecy, a self licking ice cream cone of grift, graft, corruption, backhanders and bullshit!
1	I took the Pfizer Vaccine which is great
0	You cannot remove experimental synthetic RNA from your genetics
0	Well, clearly the vax is racist and hates freedom.
1	Be wise and live.Take the vaccine and obey all rules.
0	The vaccine did not past the human-testing stage before releasing to us so in conclusion we're like the lab rat
0	Propaganda
0	I will not get the vaccine and I will not produce a weekly test unless my job offers it on-site at no cost nor unreasonable time consumption to myself.
0	After months of waiting, the autopsy report today CONFIRMS that BBC journalist  @LisaShawRadio died from the vaccine. We were right again.
1	I got both shots for pfiezer. Arm was sore for a day or two. Literally the only side effect. My siblings got sick when the got it, but they laid down for a day and were fine. Y’all would rather get a life changing and destroying disease then have a sore arm or have to take a sick day?
0	how does the vaccine "protect those around you?"
0	The fact that they have to repeat this message continually makes me feel like they are trying too hard to convince us that it is true
0	Stop listening to 'experts'. None are. Turn off the tv, and stop listening to CNN, MSNBC....and this will be over tomorrow.
0	Young soccer/football players in the UK have died from heart failure caused by the vaccine.
1	What is hidden in the propagation of the right to self-harm is not only that the general public has to pay for it in terms of costs, but that all the caring people who are then needed because one has damaged oneself have to shoulder the rucksack of the failures.
1	now she completed her booster already..  I am proud mama..
1	Oh yes, because 5 minutes of Google research is much more than 20 years of medical expirience.
1	I’m also going to kept wearing my mask even after I’m fully vaccinated in three weeks.
0	There's the all seeing eye. Medicines agency. Regular booster shots will be fatal.
0	You are vaccinated and got the booster shot and you still got covid? Then what does getting vaccinated actually do for someone?
1	Happy to help patients get their COVID Vaccines
0	I find it amazing that as soon as the alleged pandemic began, conflicts of interest ended.
0	Covid will give me a cough temperature or any of its mild symptoms -as a healthy teenager-the vaccine might or might not give me shitty health problems so I’d rather take my chances with a two week cough
1	Thank you scientists for working hard!
1	I got my first dose today, was nervous at first but feel very relieved that I got it.
0	We now know natural immunity is stronger and longer than vaccine immunity. It’s time to apologize and rehire doctors and nurses fired even though they already had contracted COVID.
0	The lines for natural immunity with and without vaccine are essentially the same. Natural immunity alone is super immunity.
1	Vaccines are an incredible thing and I'm grateful that we have them
1	I got the Pfizer and it's not fake. No side effects. Didn't even feel the needle. I know several other people who have been vaccinated too and had no side effects.
0	My buddies friend died shortly after getting the second shot .. real safe .
0	it is Already WORLD WAR 3. The "vaccine" is the BULLET!!!!
0	I would rather get omicron twice than take the vaccine
0	I'll be happy too, right after you shove your masks and vaccines straight up your backside.
1	Fully vaxxed and shit😊😊
1	I thought I was at risk due to medication allergies but after speaking to my doctor, she recommended the COVID-19 vaccine.  I got the Moderna one and fully vaccinated since March. I didn't have any major side effects and I'm still doing fine
0	There would not be "Swarms of Anti Vaxxers" if it was "safe and effective" which it's obviously not. Good luck with perpetual boosters
1	It doesn’t matter what we think. The consensus of the medical community is that you need to get vaccinated. Listen to the medical community, not random people on the internet.
0	My kids will NOT get the jab!!! They don't want it either!
1	The fast way to double the effective vaccine supply is to not give it to republicans and let them walk their talk.
1	Your reply and info is appreciated. So much clear info re covid-19 and vaccines means I will get vaxxed.
0	Just say NO to the little prick!
1	The science wasn't rushed. Vaccines derived from RNA technology has been around for decades.
1	Keep up with the latest anti-vaxxers who have died of covid at sorryantivaxxers.com
1	I got the vaccine as I was offered it and I have taken every vaccine ever offered to me and am reasonably fine
1	People that say ''we don't know what's inside the vaccine'' are also the ones snorting lines from club bathrooms like it was their daily vitamin pill
1	Can’t wait for the antis to start explaining to us how this is somehow completely wrong.
0	Why would any one place their faith in something as flawed and imperfect as medical science. Faith belongs only to Jesus.
1	After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first.
1	HOW is this still a question when so many doses already have been given with so few side-effects.
0	The study is a single page with no data tables or definitions. Same people lied about IVM and HCQ.
0	World should protest against vaccine
1	Just get the damn jab
0	Your Government are killing you all.. yes killing you all read that again and again and again.. comply YOU WILL DIE simple as.. vaccines KILL end all NOW..
1	Why no one is talking about the actual covid side effects? My father has long term lung and heart damage from covid. Before, he was a normal healthy person.
1	In summary: Being fully boosted DOES significantly reduce the chances of getting infected w/ Omicron. Vaccines DO reduce transmission of Omicron. Vaccines DO keep nearly everyone out of hospital & ICU. For yourself & those around you, get fully vaccinated! Be safe. (/end)
0	It doesn't affect your body if you don't take it.
1	Research shows that unvaccinated have a 25% chance to be hospitalised due to COVID-19 and 53 times more likely to die!!!
1	“Researchers from the same study from Israel found that previously infected people benefited from vaccination, as those who received a single dose of the vaccine were about half as likely (0.53 fold) to be reinfected as those who did not get the shot.” I noticed you left that part out. You also left out that the study hasn’t been peer reviewed or accepted by the scientific community.
1	Don’t wait for the possibility of new variant updates, get your vaccine boosters as soon as eligible, you don’t want to catch Covid-19 and pass it on to others at this point.
0	vaccines and masks don’t stop transmission
1	myocarditis and pericarditis are also symptoms of COVID. This is why it can arise with the vaccine, but with a major difference. With vaccine = 1-2 days of mild symptoms while NO vaccine = 9-12 days with long-term cardiac damage.
1	Please get vaccinated.
1	Side effects that are incredibly rare though. Like I'd rather take that risk than take a much higher risk by not vaccinating.
1	I got vaccinated today!!!!
0	I got infected while vaccinated, I know
1	I got moderna 3 days ago. I am fully satisfied with my decision
1	If you're sucking dick at a sip 'n paint, don't worry about what's in the vaccine.
0	I have no sympathy towards anyone who voluntarily took those lethal jabs. The truth is out there for all to read.
0	When the time comes I'm going to let a liberal have mine and wait a few years to see what happens to them before I let anyone inject another experiment in my arm!
1	Trying to find a middle ground with anti-vaxxers is like taking out my brain and carefully slicing it in half.
1	I am not anti-vax thanks
0	And today the cdc posted this study:https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e1.htm#T2_down of hundreds of patients from New york and California which demonstrates that starting in June 2021 natural immunity provided greater protection than vaccines. Look at the science, folks, if you have the balls. Or stick to your prejudices and read the WA post: the post doesn’t report on the latest CDC research. Any half-assed reporter could go to a protest, interview a hundred people, and present the stupidest people from that large group as examplars of a perspective they are already prejudiced against to foment more prejudice and hatred. And you can read it and hate and call names and think about how smart you are and how stupid everyone you disagree with is, and ignore the science the cdc has just published.
0	I’ve had every vaccine but this one. How does that make one anti-vaccine?
0	They can go to hell with their wicked vaccines.
1	Received Moderna booster shot and felt stronger and alert
1	They are usually safer than the disease statistically. The risk/reward is in favor of getting vaccinated. There are some that can have severe adverse effects.
0	I am not ready to be vaccinated. I will run with natural immunity
1	Get vaccinated as soon as it's your turn. Protect yourself
0	IT DOESN'T STOP YOU FROM GETTING COVID!  But the pharm. Are making LOTS of money and they are exempt from any future issues.
0	The reasons I was and still am against the vaccine(s) is because the Pharmaceutical companies wanted immunity from prosecution if things went wrong, and the Governments (worldwide) allowed it's distribution and use under emergency powers. From day one that rang major alarm bells.
1	Please take your boosters and vaccines.
0	No thanks - take my chances with my natural immunity from Covid over the experimental jab 100x over.
0	We are 83% plus vaccinate for the ages 5+. That is incredible in itself. The only way to get to 100% is to give up certain freedoms and force the vaccine. Is this what people are cheering for here? What is the goal of these restrictions?
0	DO NOT FORCE THIS VACCINE AND POOF WORKERS ARE BACK
1	I think covaxin is the best. No adverse events.
1	HAS IT BEEN TESTED AND DID IT WORK
1	I just got my 1st dose of Pfizer Vaccine today...
1	Please start talking to your friends and loved ones to gently warm them towards the idea of taking the vaccine.
1	Is it possible to take it earlier?
0	I do not need the Corona vaccine. I just need to listen to music every day to boost my immunity because it is better and better vaccination.
1	I support mandatory vaccination for everyone
0	Translation: We have found yet another way to encourage you fools to line up for our obscenely profitable snake oil!
0	The vaccine does not serve to protect you from Covid but to enable the later activation of your future digital identity... That's why Véran is so keen on giving us all at least one dose. #VeranCharlatan
1	I got my booster a few weeks ago and have had no side effects at all.
0	There are numerous flaws with why you should get vaccinated. 1. You can still be infected with COVID. 2. You can still spread COVID. 3. You can still die from COVID. The only difference between vaxxed and unvaxxed is one person got a shot and one didn’t. Sheeple ffs
1	I got my Pfizer vaccination today
0	Covid has a 99.7% survival rate. The shot gives a lowered % rate. Let nature take its course like the body was made to do.
0	Surprised to even find this, but then again im on duck duck go. Be prepared for people to call you crazy for preaching the truth. The vaccine wasn't rolled out for covid rather covid was rolled out for the vaccine. They've had it all along they just needed the perfect crisis
0	2 dose is all i will ever take.
1	walk-in #COVIDVaccine clinics. We're operating walk-in clinics for dose 1 and 2 for people aged 12 and older, and booster vaccine clinics for people aged 16 and older.
1	I got my two shots in the only side effect my arm hurt
0	Christine Anderson tells it like it is…#CovidVaccine is not a game changer…you can still contract #coronavirus and spread it…$Billions into pockets of pharmaceutical companies…no Govt grants us freedom, because we are free.
0	Everyone is scared of covid but not injecting unresearched poison? Okay.
1	Vaccine is not only for ourselves protection. But also protection for those who are around us. People who we love and care. I do understand those who have lots allergy,  sensitive to drug, pregnant women why are scare/hesitate of taking vaccine.
0	Do you not know that many have died from this vaccine and many are suffering with adverse effects??  Are you guys oblivious to what's going on in this world? Yet you still believe this vaccine is safe?  You guys have lost the plot...you're a danger to society!
0	Since my first Covid Vaccine shot; Moderna at CVS in NYS on April 9th . I have experienced trouble breathing and neck pain that has not gone away. I eat a very clean diet but slacked off a bit so I decided to do a cleanse to see if that was the reason. I am still having isssues. I usually have abundant energy and now I am suffering from fatigue and breathing problems. I canceled my second shot last week and will not be getting it anytime soon. Please advise or if anyone else has experienced this please post. Thanks.
0	Well I got my vaccine and it was the worst thing I’ve ever done in my life!! No wonder people r hesitant. People should be hesitant!
0	simple, you can’t trust that it is safe !, does safe mean that it only adversly affects 3–4 people in every thousand ??, is not safe for those 3–4 acceptable ??, i personally don’t object to anyone taking the vaccine if they want to !, but why should i be forced into taking an experimental vaccine that will remain experimental for at least another year ( big pharma’s words, not mine), when they say that it won’t stop you catching the virus or for that matter, passing it on ??
1	There were genuinely more people at some of my high school cheerleading competitions than were gathered around the reflecting pool yesterday. These people are fringe weirdos, and don't deserve the ink you give them. This whole story could have been a sentence: "Small crowd of deranged extremists gather in nation's capital to vociferously reject science."
1	"Say there's a measles outbreak here."    Covid 19: "Allow me to introduce myself."
1	Omicron is not mild Get your Fourth Booster Now
0	Yes good idea. Sleepy Joe and his supporters should be jabbed at least once a day until they disappear.
0	Smart man!  I’m not getting that shot either!
0	An FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research advisory panel discussion declared that the risk of myocarditis was higher than COVID-19 in males under the age of 40.
1	So people are saying they’d much rather die than have a vaccine, I say that’s a win.
1	I got both vaccines, the worst side effect I got was 1 night of a slight fever. I wish everyone would just take the vaccine so we can live normally and safely again
1	After spending days bathing in MM's aerosols in a relatively small room for DAYS, remember that our vaccines, both hers and mine, protected me.
1	I’m fully vaccinated and that was my choice. If people don’t want to get vaccinated that is also their choice. I think that the vaccine is a positive thing but I also think that in the land of the free people should be free to do what they want with their bodies.
0	Power to the people! Never surrender!
1	I got covid19 last week, I had weak syntoms! thanks to the vaccine, i will take my booster shot in 2 weeks
0	The vaccine probably killed her.
1	imagine a vaccine so safe you have to be threatened to take it
1	I hope people realize that the pro-vaccine people are all doctors, and experts while the anti-vaxxers are uneducated people.
0	What are the benefits of getting a COVID-19 vaccine? Absolutely NONE; vaccine is detrimental to your spiritual and physical health; forgive me.
0	DON'T GET THE VACCINE
1	I would be ok with some side effects if the vaccines actually worked.
0	No,I will not. The current vaccine prospects are being rushed through trials exceedingly quickly, and as such their safety will be far from proven when rolled out.
1	1. People get vaccinated. 2. Less people in hospital. 3. Panic is over.
0	The whole world literally pushes you to get this vaccine and if you don’t you’ll be an outsider and they call you names because of it. Idk what to do anymore I’m just so scared
0	Anyway when me and my partner (also unvaxxed) turned up to the gathering we made everyone's jaws drop. We basically looked a decade younger than everyone else there. Well as you can imagine us being sexy-as-fuck sure made it hard for any of my nosy vaxxed friends to give us any 'hEaLtH aDvIcE'.
1	I love how well all know the vacciness don't keep you from getting or spreading the virus, but reduce the risk of hospitalization; all the while, still demanding that everybody get one to protect others
0	I already had it no more shots for me!
0	Vax status: Unvaccinated, 2X, 3X.
0	If you blindly trust these companies you're a fool. Good luck with that!
0	I’m not just going to get on a bandwagon like the rest and just get the vaccine
1	It would be better if people got the vaccine
1	You won't get the vax? then stay the hell home and don't be around anyone.
0	4 BILLION have been vaccinated worldwide, yet the number of covid cases are close to 4 MILLION.  The data does not lie. The vaccines are failures. It's time to change the narrative and listen to other experts in the field.
1	The CDC says people with allergies to certain foods, insects, latex and other common allergens can get a COVID-19 vaccine.
0	I'm a nice guy. Someone else can have my dose ;)
1	Still, 63.8% is not enough! We need more vaccinated! Vaccines save lives!
1	all these people who didn’t finish school and can’t spell or use grammar are saying the vaccine is bad
0	WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BRAINS OF THE VACCINATED.
1	"For the first time in history the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who refuse to take it."
1	Or maybe it's a functional vaccine that is saving lives and preventing hospitalizations.
1	Hate anti vaxers, blame them for the rising cases, selfish pigs
0	This is not about a virus. This is about increasing the power of the State and weakening personal freedoms.
1	I love this ! I'm going now to get vaccinated  thank you so much
0	Vaccine has killed 4262 people in the US. 99.7% recovery rate from covid which is the flu. No thanks to vaccine.
0	I just got over covid and my mother is still sending me WebMD trash articles and telling me I’m in mortal danger if I don’t get vaccinated. They broke people. Shattered them beyond repair.
1	Parents who don't vaccinate their kids should be charged with child abuse and public endangerment
1	Unvaccinated friend with COVID is dissatisfied with available treatments. Her likeminded friends are offering to send her ‘packets’ from “a guy I know” & another from “a website.” People who don’t trust FDA-approved vaccines are willing to take whoknowswhat from whoknowswhere.
0	it begs the question does it not - why do they want to decimate the military with these dangerous vaccines
1	I am a GP. I have had 3 Doses of the #CovidVaccine. I have also had every other vaccine I have been advised to have by Healthcare Professionals from birth onwards to help protect me and those around me from serious illness and disease.
0	If the vaccines work so well, how does the unvaccinated put the vaccinated in danger?
0	Finally we are getting somewhere. Proof that the vaccine dies not work, you mean.
0	Vaccine mandates should never be legalised.
1	Both my wife and I work in healthcare those nurses are weird libertarians. They are less than 1% of us. 99% of healthcare workers would recommend getting vaccinated.
1	No amount of evidence will ever persuade an idiot
1	Yeah, I got covid a week after the second shot and thank God that I did. I am 55 and overweight and I didn't fall super ill, it was weird and I could feel how the vaccine was helping me not to get sicker. I am convinced that if I hadn't been vaccinated that I would have ended up in the ER or worse. People GET VACCINATED!!!!!
1	My Mom has had Cancer since 2008. WBC usually low. She took her vaccine and Survived Covid along a MAJOR neck surgery at the same time. All glory to God. Medical Science are here to help. Get your vaccine.  Yes she got sick of Covid even when vaccinated but did not need hospitalization. She was in the hospital because of surgery.
1	I am a healthcare worker but my work is administrative, so I work from home. I'm also young and healthy. I won't be eligible for the vaccine until the last phases. I want it mostly to do my part; I am cognizant that I personally am unlikely to be adversely affected were I to catch COVID due to my health and demographics, but my life isn't the only one that matters. I stay home and wear a mask when grocery shopping because I have the basic human decency to care about possibly inadvertently causing someone else harm or death. Anyone without medical reason to avoid vaccines that choose not to get this one is frankly selfish.
0	The COVID-19 is not an FDA approved vaccine, it's experimental....it's junk, you take it Doctor and you can have my shot too.
0	The vaccine hasn't done shit. Everyone is know who got the vaccine still ended up WITH COVID, many of em were down bad with it.\\n\\nIt doesn't mean shit when it's not doing its intended purpose.
1	Trust the science that brought you both the vaccine and the disease.
0	Its crazy how so many "experts" and "doctors" are on board pushing these vaccines and mandates thinking it is what will save your life.
0	But he was OK and healthy before the vaccine. It's like updating a computer with no issues at all. When the update was installed, issue started.
1	I like the idea of a new vaccine that actually works
0	I knew this Vaccine was not safe,, people are dying that has been fully vaccinated and still get sick
1	don’t comply with getting vaxxinated and see how far you get  you’ll be the small minority where the vast majority ride the pandemic out and get on with your lives whilst you’re sat at home paranoid about the government reading your thoughts whilst you’re on the toilet at 3am
1	The AstraZenica and Johnson-Johnson vaccines are known to have very rare side effects. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccins do not have known side effects.
1	There are a few vaccinated people who have died but they are the exceptions. Nearly everyone who has gotten very sick in recent months from Covid was not vaccinated. No vaccine is 100% due to complexities of our bodies. But the vaccines are very effective at preventing nearly all severe consequences
0	Avoid it like the plague!
1	Vaccine should be mandated when appeals to take vaccines fall into deaf ears. You are only protecting your citizens and your healthcare system from being overwhelmed.
1	This is the point when vaccination were available to everybody. Makes sense to measure from the point people could do something real to prevent death.
1	People never cease to amaze me with their ignorance... Thank you, John Oliver for this important piece of information.
1	I see the COVID-19 vaccine as a very much necessary precaution and it's important to get it so we as a society can build up a sort of herd immunity to the virus
0	Is this real? There has to be something to nitpick in this. Please crush my dreams so I can't get my hopes up.
0	I hope everyone that does get a vaccine ends up being well, but I can't say I'm comfortable getting a medicine that doesn't have 5-10 years of rigorous real world testing to various, unforeseen consequences and interactions. It seems like an overreaction to get humans en mass to test these new medicines. We have animal trials for a reason.
0	CDC is corrupt, covid is fake
1	We should not let those "vaccine skeptics" (who we should call anti-vaxxers) infect other people as it pleases them. We, others, have been silent too long now!!!!!
0	Two shots was enough thank you. You can stick the rest wherever you like, but not in my arm
0	It's not the vacine I'm worried about it's the government I dont trust
1	I have had both vaccines thank you to the scientists
0	Vaccines are dangerous, my child is fine and she hasn’t been vaccinated. Instead I use healing crystals
0	And what about the countless severe adverse effects that thousands of people, including me, are suffering from since they got their shot(s)? One shot of this experimental "vaccine" changed my life to a nightmare. Just as well as so many other's.
0	Never vaxed, never sick, never scared FJB
1	herd immunity for the delta variant requires 80-90% immunity. We are only at 55% due to all the anti-vaxxers.
0	there is lacking research on long term side effects
0	If anyone "forces" anything on me, I will defend myself to my last dying breath.
1	I love it! A super spreader event during one of the most contagious periods of the pandemic.
1	Most vaccines are good, there are just some that are bad. I’ve been vaccinated quite a few times, and I’m fine.
1	If it wasn’t for the risk of them infecting vulnerable people I would say that anti-vaxers are part of nature’s great plan for natural selection.
1	Literally millions and millions worldwide have had the vaccine. A scant handful have reported genuine minor and temporary side effects. The anti vax propaganda machine has been churning out a ton of fear inducing misinformation - ignore them.
1	My 70 yo mom is receiving her 1st dose #vaccine today &amp; I am thrilled for her! #COVIDVaccine #COVID #Moderna #fridaymorning
1	Stay strong. Praying for you to recover. Don’t listen to the idiots! The vaccine in most cases prevents death from COVID and helps u from getting it at all. No one said you couldn’t get sick it’s just that the possibility is so much smaller if vaccinated. They don’t get that!
1	All the vaccines being used have been produced by large and known pharmaceutical companies. It is our duty to be all vaccinated to stop Covid
0	Was under the impression that two shots of phizer would keep me alive and out of the hospital. Why take a third if the effectiveness against catching covid wanes so quickly. even the vax makers are saying this. Unless I am incorrec, send my booster to COVAx.
0	How can anyone say a drug that doesn't have any long-term test results yet is totally safe? That's the main reason I'm skeptical about it.
0	LEAVE OUR CHILDREN ALONE!!!
0	To be pressured into this political population control is not good!
0	I decline it because of natural immunity. I had a serious case of Covid Pneumonia and endured a lengthy hospitalization. There are now at least 16 professional studies that conclude with no dissenting opinion that natural immunity provides far superior protection against further infection than the Covid vaccines do. Furthermore, natural immunity does not weaken over time, and I will avoid the risk of serious side effects. Lastly, it was concluded that the vaccines could damage important infection fighting T-cells that are unique to those with natural immunity. The bottom line is the vaccines offer no benefit to me, and actually pose a risk to my immune structure.
0	2 officers from work took the Vaccine, 2 months later they got Covid 19 and died
0	I am ashamed to admit it, but until covid I believed that every vaccine was safe and effective, and that anti-vaxxers were dangerous lunatics. Now I know that no vaccine is as safe or as effective as we are told, and that anti-vaxxers are principled freedom-fighters.
0	Lol. The first two didn't work...lol
1	before you say you refuse to take the vaccine because you don’t know what’s in it, name every single ingredient in the soda you drink, poptarts u eat and ur toothpaste without looking it up
1	The scientists were studying this new vaccines for 3 years thats why we got the vaccine so fast! Its amazin
1	I understand that people are desperately searching for cures as COVID continues to infect our families as loved ones. The good news is we have an FDA-approved vaccine. Please take it. Don’t risk ingesting medicine meant for horses. It’s not worth it
0	NO NO and a million times NO. NO compulsory jabs. Not at all
0	"If someone dies WITH covid-19, we are counting that as a Covid-19 death." - Direct quote from Dr. Birx at the Coronavirus Task Force press conference. You could literally make a stuffy nose the leading cause of death using this rule.
0	Urghh this disgusting propaganda, be a lab rat and take an untested gene therapy that failed animal trials and has never been tested for long term safety
0	“When will COVID end?” He said: “When the world gets vaccinated” hahahahahahah to think I thought this video would be worth wasting 10 minutes watching
1	No Excuses...! NO FEAR...!NO RUMOURS...! YES TO COVID VACCINE...!Just take your vaccine when You will get chance or receive notification by govt. authority
1	It's interesting that leftists say 'my body, my choice', when it comes to k!lling babies but do not say the same when mandated experimental jabs are f0rced into them.
0	I hope the trial goes well.
0	Sorry but I’m not gonna get 3+ shots just to still get the disease, I don’t get my flu shot for the same reason
1	When's the last time you heard of someone getting Polio? Or Smallpox? That's because of vaccines.
1	Try not to be scared of the vaccine, it’s protecting you against something roughly 10,000 times more risky (Covid-19 disease).
1	One of my friends is an Instagram influencer. He has a huge 6-figure following. And every day he is spreading covid misinformation. Why? I’m not sure. He likes to go against the crowd to look cool. But he’s not a doctor. He doesn’t care. He’s not linking to scientific research. He’s simply stating that governments can’t be trusted. Can you trust a deadly virus though? No. Covid doesn’t care what Instagram says. It will put people you love in the cemetery. Takeaway, The vaccine gives you a level of protection. In a global pandemic that’s a good position to be in
0	I have so much pressure to have this vaccine but my gut tells me no.
0	Vaccine not approved by the FDA < Vaccine Approved by FDA, I have been double crossed by the people in charge of these companies far too many times, I will wait for the FDA to approve it.
0	"our vaccines don't really work but you should still get them"
0	I am 79year old and afraid of taking booster
1	2nd dose!  happy to report ZERO side effects from 1st dose, and nothing yet from 2nd dose!
0	Don't let them put this on the children's vaccine schedule.
1	in short, YES GET VACCINATED, PLEASE
1	No side effects after Covid vaccine #1. Only experienced a brief period of fatigue after Covid #2 and #3 (booster).
0	To all my unvaxxed brethren out there: HOLD THE LINE!!!
0	How vaccine works? They don't!
0	Fake pandemic is being played by greedy pharma companies and politicians.
1	I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine 2 months ago and so far I have been filling fine with no problems. The only thing I had from it was just two side effects from it and that was it and since then I have been filling fine but a little scared because of all the rumors going around
0	Actually this vaccine is the best way to get Covid not prevent it.
0	Wake up people, so sad, way too many people taking a useless shot they think will save their lives
1	why are people still having problems getting the covid vaccines? get your god damn shots if i gotta do it you have to too
1	Almost weekly I read a story about 1 or both unvaccinated parents dying and leaving kids behind. Those kids are going to grow up, learn the truth, and say, "Our parents were idiots".
0	How much money are you putting into coercing people into taking this experimental medication. People have immune systems they do not need to become lab rats to protect them from a virus with a 99%+ survival rate. Are you informing them they are part of a clinical trial or of any of the MANY severe adverse reactions taking place? Shameful propaganda!
0	This vaccination will lead to something not to prevent Corona virus please
1	Gunfire has killed 111 officers in the past two years Covid has killed over 620 officers in the same time period If youre an officer who wears a bulletproof vest and carries a gun to protect yourself from Gunfire, you should get vaccinated as well The odds are too high not to.
1	I got my 2nd shot yesterday and been dealing with sore arm and fatigue today. Mild inconvenience to save others from covid.
1	It’s not freedom of speech to say the public’s confidence in the Covid vaccine is “mass psychosis”.   That’s anti-science cult propaganda.
1	Just get vaccinated
1	I’m getting mine on Friday :)
0	This Covid vaccine has only been given since December, so the long-term health effects are still unknown. It’s not FDA-approved, and it’s still being studied in clinical trials. There is a Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System where you can go look up how many people have been killed or paralyzed by the shot. Want to guess the number?  Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies have been granted immunity from liability by the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act. If you're not in the 0.02% of elderly and people with comorbidities who die from Covid, then the only reason to take the shot is because of Covid-phobia: irrational fear of Covid.
1	It will be a hell of a life, being unvaccinated
1	Got my 2nd dose of vaccine no symptoms and no pain
1	Yea, people who get the vaccine can still get it. They just become 95% less likely to get it. This is huge, so let’s not discount it.
1	damn, the vaccine is so perfect they might as well say that it gives you eternal life.
0	Vaccine mandates are paralyzing the capital!
1	I tested positive 1/4, if it wasn’t for a work test, would have never have known. Not a sniffle. None of the 20+ people I was with from 12/25-1/1 (most prior + vax/boost) and nobody else had any fallout. Lost a non vax friend Saturday. I’m a firm believer.
0	This vaccine is dangerous.
1	Show me a person who has been double vaccinated and died from covid who wasn't over 60 cos there isn't any
1	"Liberty"..? This was really strange to see, coming from a developing country I always thought that getting vaccinated was more like a privilege.
0	Sooooo...we were guinea pigs to test mRNA in humans.😒
0	I had covid and was fine after, I had 1 dose of Pfizer and am still having adverse reactions 3 months + later
0	This is so cringe it’s actually sinister. How are these lies allowed ?
1	I'd much rather have the vaccine than have this virus.
0	Can t wait in 5-10 years. A lawyer commercial coming on the television saying have you or a loved one been affected but covid vaccine. Hahah let s be honest folks a vaccine protects you from getting a virus meaning the inject a live virus for your body to build an immunity to. This shot mutates your T cells genetically. It s not a live virus. So has anyone asked what s the real agenda behind the shot
0	I dont want it and have no interest in getting it
0	Shame on all those vaccinated who believed the vaccines helped when infact by the time they had them covid had run through most the population thus creating herd immunity. How stupid some people be. Sheeps.
1	How are these vaccines getting approved when there's no long-term studies
0	4 people in my household. 2 fully vaxxed, 2 under the age to be vaxxed. All positive for covid. The vaccine doesn’t do a whole lot against omicron.
0	PARENTS SHOULD REALLY THINK TWICE BFORE THEY VACCINATE THERE CHILDREN !!!!!!
0	The fully vaccinated "may need to boost again. That's entirely conceivable." Fauci, ABC News 1/23/22
0	18 months these people worked without one. I support their decision to not get vaccinated!
0	Just wait about a year or two ... then tell us how it worked out .
0	F"*ck that vaccin. Don't be stupid to inject your self with that sh*t. Ps fu*k any mandatory vaccination program. If that sh*t happens let start murdering authorities. My body my choice
0	I'm not "one of those" types but these "see it's safe!" videos are so unbearable... We literally have zero idea what they're actually being injected with.
0	At the end of the day its your own choice but theres no way in hell im getting vaccinated lol
1	I love how everyone is so fixated on the long term effects of the vaccine, when they don't even consider the long term effects of being infected with covid.
0	I'm not hesitant!.......I'm very sure I won't take this new vaccine.
1	Queue all the anti-vaxxers with skewed statistics and links to random WordPress sites
0	to be clear, none of the mRNA vaccines produced or approved for EUA use, have passed all trials required by fda
1	As a nurse working covid was the most demoralizing experience of my life. I went to grad school so i wouldnt have to work for a few years
0	Just stop. Its a bloody cold. Everyone has got it. The difference between those who have a cold and those who have covid is a test.
0	We can’t trust them. Very many vaccinated individuals got covid after Moderna vaccines
0	No news is coming out that makes me doubt that I made the correct choice by not taking the woke poke. I have a suspicion that even more bad news about it is on the horizon.
1	Can anone point me to successful coronavirus vaccines? Not for covid-19, just any? When I try researching the results are entirely polluted with covid-19 even when i use boolean searches eliminating.
0	It takes 5 to 10 years to completely check safety in a vaccine NOT a few weeks.
0	How they work? No need to watch the video. Simple answer: They don't!
1	The risks associated with organ transplants are off the charts whereas the risk associated with the vaccine are minuscule. This is like someone who rides a motorcycle helmet-less every day refusing to fly on a commercial airline because it's too dangerous.
0	Look at third world countries that are doing much better with omicron despite their very low vaccination rate; natural immunity is more effective than vaccination.
1	I spend a lot of time looking at the evidence objectively, and the vaccines seem like the safer bet.
1	A lot of vaccine haters don't respond to contradicting replies... It's really sad when somebody refuses to convert to an actual educated opinion
0	Why ever would people be hesitant about a rushed, liability free product?
1	I got dose 2 of my Pfizer Covid vaccine yesterday yeah.
0	We have to get the unvaccinated vaccinated to make them safe so we can protect the vaccinated who have already been made safe.
0	My daughter has suffered severe vaccine injuries. Rushed to ER many times. Please do not down play it!
1	Well done Israel, one of the few countries which took covid seriously
1	I got vaccinated and boosted and I wear a mask because I want fewer people to get sick and die. It's pretty simple. If those things are too much of a personal sacrifice for you and if 850,000 funerals don't move you enough to care about people, that's on you.
1	I live in a massive anti-vaxx society. I want to get involved in the trials just so to be even more alien to said society.
0	Stop forcing this EXPERIMENT!!!!!!!! If all of them would stand together and stop working,they could not mandate anything anymore...
0	Many vaccines are tested for years on animals before tried on the public. My concern with the new mRNA vaccines, which have not been tested for years in animals first, is that there is a possibility that in a year or two, there is a possibility that these mRNA vaccines could cause our own cells to become cancerous. Which is worse on your long-term health? Severe flu-type viruses, such as CoVid-19, or cancer?
0	I hope they the capacity to handle all the sick people they will have from this mass vaccination two years from now.
1	I don't understand why some people don't even do one. Go on, get vaccinated!
0	Imagine sitting there and lying to lexs face about how safe the vaccines are wow
0	The vaccines are so safe, the FDA doesn’t want to release information on the vaccine until 2076.
0	The vaccines aren't about helping you not get the virus or any of that. It's for population control / NWO..Can't believe people are still falling for this BS!!!
1	Because they're purposely ignorant. That's why they refuse.
0	No to discrimination!
0	Do not obey! Never surrender!
1	I just feel bad for the doctors, i could not care less about the patients that refuse to get vaccinated after getting covid.
0	Speaking of spreading misinformation, you do know that it literally has no measurable effect on transmission whether or not you’re vaccinated, right?
1	The biggest benefit is that you are a lot less likely to get infected with COVID-19, and will likely have a much milder case and recover quicker if you do, making you less likely to infect others in turn.  Side benefit: hugging your friends and family is AWESOME!
0	Natural immunity is durable vaccine is not.
0	Exactly, they “forgot” to mention this one. The media is desperately trying to show the unvaccinated as illiterate and uneducated, and that’s not true. The more they push the shot the more I’ll refuse to take it.
0	We dont trust the vaccine....how difficult is that to understand ?
1	This is where under funding education and Healthcare has gotten us. Eating freaking dewormer, when a perfectly good vaccine is right there.
0	IT IS NOT A CURE. IT IS A POISION
0	I’m just waiting for a few more years pass & we find out that it was all just the biggest money grab in our history
0	Two weeks after having the first Pfizer vaccine, my father was in hospital with his first ever heart attack. He was told he had several blood clots in his heart. In the few weeks that followed, he had three more attacks.
1	Protect yourself and get vaccinated
0	The only thing it protects against is normal heart function.
1	Vaccines were only supposed to be for over 65s but pharma had to get greedy
1	There not telling us what it's made of wtf when i got vaccinated i got a whole ass information packet with the brand of the vaccine, the type of vaccine, a full list of the vaccine's ingredients, list of side effects, at home aftercare, and warnings for ppl at risk of bein hurt by the vaccine.
1	[are these vaccines safe? The answer is yes, ] Except that all of them are technically experimental vaccines at this point. Maybe it's necessary to allow people to try experimental vaccines during a pandemic. But we shouldn't pretend they are not experimental vaccines. Also, though, why begin to administer them in nations where the pandemic has already reached a projected course of natural deline
1	Consult your doctor. If you are eligible for the booster shot, with your doctor's approval, get it as soon as possible. Protect yourself from Covid and post-covid health issues due to Long Covid. Your health matters.
1	Vaccines! Yay!
1	I am BOOSTED. It saved my life
1	only idiots won't take the vaccine
1	The First Corona Vaccine was invented in Russia, Everyone is optimistic....
1	Get vaccinated #HowToNotBeAJerk
1	Just from scrolling through the comments and reading the reasons not to take it makes me want to take it more.
0	If you've made it this far unvaccinated, give yourself a hug. Stay free.
1	Vaccines SAVE lives.
1	I got 2 shots of the vaccine. Hopefully I will be fine. I pray for everyone to get vaccinated and stop the resistance against the vaccine.
1	Without strict measures and mandatory vaccination we will never get rid of the pandemic.
0	Don't ever take something the people in the top investing in it won't take themselves.
1	I’m 14 days after my 2nd pfeizer dose.  I had a sore arm as side effects.  No biggie.
0	They all work the same,  an ambulance comes for you in the end
0	Consumers: Are vaccines safe?  Vaccine Manufacturers: We'll know in about 3-5 years. In the meantime definitely keep taking them as much as we tell you to
0	Respect those who choose not to get vaccinated and don't alter their quality of life.
0	I just wonder why does the whole world needs to be vaccinated?
0	"Your alleged rights, end up being somebody's wrongs" ????? My right to my bodyly autonomy does not infringe on your rights to your body. If you get vaccinated then it doesn't matter to you if I don't, it doesn't matter to you even if I am sick with covid because you are "protected"!!! But , if I am young , healthy, not overweight individual who survived covid, there is more danger for me getting the vax then not!!!!!!!
0	No, I won't since 55 people in the United States have died after receiving COVID-19 vaccines.
1	The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one. (Mr. Spock) This is not the Delta variant, it's the Darwin variant. But still the selfish and misinformed want the "freedom" to remain unvaccinated and not wear a mask to protect their fellow Americans. Freedom comes with responsibility.
0	I wont take vaccine. I mean why would I?
1	Getting vaccinated prevents severe illness.  Why is this so hard to comprehend?
0	You cannot. There are no long-term studies and literally hundreds of scientists and doctors that warn for the serious side effects that they expect will occur and that already have occured. There are already so many deaths and hospitalizations in VAERS that there is plenty of reason to worry. VAERS, Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, is the official US reporting system that according to Harvard Medical School reports only 1% of adverse reactions to vaccines. This means that there could be as many as 1,300,000 deaths from COVID-vaccines already (updated numbers as per Aug. 13th). But they just don’t admit it and deliberately discourage people to report. But even if reporting is 10% we are talking about at least 130,000 deaths and half a million hospitalizations.  In the EU they are currently (sept. 2021) at more than 23,000 COVID vaccine deaths (Source: EudraVigilance).  With COVID they called everything COVID to bring the numbers up, now they do the opposite to make it look as if the vaccines are safe
1	If the vaccines were the cause of death, wouldn't you expect to see more deaths within 21 days of vaccination.
0	Vaccines are safe  so is Russian roulette until it isn't.
1	I think if you dont vaccinate you almost have to go with the proper masks for safety then. Its literally a shield. WIthout it you are inviting yourself to pure exposure, for reasons unknown. That wont help you to prevent contact or spread, the two things the virus wants.
1	Not wanting a mandate and dying from a virus are not the same thing.
0	Do not take the vaccines research the company that is making them
1	We need the Vaccine.... FAST!
0	vaccines are poisons period!!
0	You being vaccinated doesn’t stop new variants lol u still stuck in early 2020
1	I could not get out of bed during covid and go to the fridge to get food.. I love food.. get vaccinated
1	Got the vaccine. Didn't get sick or feel any different and I've never gotten COVID. This goes for tons of ppl I know too who have gotten it. I can 100% agree with people being fearful and not wanting to get it because they're being demanded to do so but I want to live my life like normal. And so far it's been fine.
0	Not vaccinated people are protected because natural immunity exist , the mutation of the virus has helped us
0	I'm a second year paediatric nurse. I'm worried that I've chosen the wrong profession. I really do not want the vaccination. 😞
0	0 risk based on what? studies that weren't even able to ask basic questions to female participants about vaccine side effects?
0	But it’s so safe! And effective! The dirty rotten politician getting money for each person jabbed said so
1	I don’t know those who have lost their loved ones to COVID will endure watching this.
1	Can't wait for my second shot. Talking to Bill Gates is going to be a bonus!
0	I still can't see how me not getting the jibjab puts the idiots who have had it at risk. It either works to protect you or it doesn't. Yet more of our money being used to propmote a companies product. These people should be ashamed.
1	Is this suggesting that the effectiveness of 2 doses is nearly zero vs omicron?
0	How many times are People be vaccinated? Poor bodies!!!!!!!
1	You don't get to "choose" to drive drunk, and if you do - you'll have to deal with the consequences. You don't get to "choose" not to vaccinate, and put people around you in danger. I find it extremely stupid that spread of disease (by not vaccinating, not wearing a mask, going out when sick, etc') isn't given a  punishment, when it equates to, in a way and farther down the line, killing a person, or many. Freedom is relative.
1	Despite age groups, who is the majority of people dying from covid? Vacced or Not vacced? So actually its the vaccine refuser who kill people.
1	where does it say that in the constitution? employers can do what they want. nurses have always required vaccinations. if you dont want it, get a new job somewhere else. work from home.
0	Make no mistake. The vaccine is not formed out of love for you.
1	Finally an end in sight. Once the whole family is vaccinated, normal life can start.
0	I’ll never get vaccinated.
0	been hearing a lot of covered up death rates after taking the vaccine. anyone have any thought on that claim ?
0	Lol. Who are you to dictate to get the vaccine. Idiots
1	Take it and god will thank you
0	The vaccines are completely identical. RNA is extremely unstable and dies very quickly, but Moderna has been developing mRNA vaccines for a while. They created and patented a solution that can keep the RNA alive longer and be stored in lesser temperatures.
0	Well if people stopped getting vaccinated there'd be less people in the hospital and maybe this would finally go away...
1	Actor Sonakshi Sinha's message is loud and clear: Vaccine is our biggest weapon in this ongoing battle against the #COVID19 pandemic. Sonakshi joins us in our mission to encourage all adults and adolescents (15-18) to get the #SurakshaKaTika against the virus. Watch, share and get vaccinated today! Register on cowin.gov.in
1	Anybody asked, it patients want to be treated by unvaccinated people?
0	They lie about this that it's safe .Not FDA approved. No way in hell will I have this
0	So after all that it’s still comes to the fact covid had to happen to provide Ginny-pigs in order to test a theory and it’s still wasn’t a 50years in the making it was just a thought to dna sequencing.  Science so great.
0	I’ve had both my vaccines but what’s the point when new variety escapes it?
0	Retired RN here, have not taken vaccination,nor will I.
0	We need to focus on healthy immune systems not vaccines , I’m not taking it
1	I want people who are unvaxxed to be not welcome in public. Much like how it is fine if you get drunk at home but a problem if you drink and drive. You have personal convictions that the vaccine is bad? Fine
0	This just shows how underdeveloped this vaccine is. We do not know enough information to argue these complications.
0	No telling what they are putting in your Body!!!!!
0	All I’m saying is you can’t chant “my body my choice” and then support a mandate without being a hypocrite
1	I’m praying that the vaccine will work and praying for a better 2021
0	Based on the deaths and hospitalizations, it makes zero sense to vaccinate children. And what is the data on children that require hospitalization? Do they have underlying health issues or are they healthy, normal weight active kids? That makes a huge difference and can help parents make reasonable decisions.
0	Yes, it is causing blood clots and strokes, etc... in many people of all ages...😧😧😧
0	I'm hosntaly asking anyone willing to answers what is the ethics behind
1	It’s time for mandatory state and federal vaccinations
1	get the shots and lets end this
0	I remember getting the flu shot one year, and  it made my arm sore temporarily and I didn't like that. So the next year, I decided to see if I could go without and see if I got sick or not that year. Well, I didn't get sick. I'm someone who doesn't really get sick especially when I take vitamins like ester-C. I actually take a whole lot of other things in addition to that, and the covid-19 virus hasn't gotten me sick yet despite being usually out 6 days of the week, so my thinking is that I don't need the vaccine to stay well, and I have a Facebook friend that has informed me about how people are dying from the vaccines, so I have decided to share no part in any of the vaccines for covid-19.
0	I have a cousin and his wife, who do vaccine research, and collectively have 40 years experience in this field .They told me never to take a vaccine....I'll listen to them.
0	I’m sitting with covid with 39C fever, fully vaccinated. Very revolutionary things are those vaccines. Waiting for the comments with an explanation that the vaccine does not prevent from sickness and so on. But in that case I would not call it a revolution.
1	Do a little research before spouting nonsense. The vaccine prevents serious cases and hospitalization. You can still spread any get COVID-19 while vaccinated. You won’t get a bad case and die from it. It’s funny how scared you are of a vaccine.
0	Just 15 more booster shots and 18 months of mask wearing and then we can get back to normal.
0	We know it’s a SCAM because you do not need vaccines for coronaviruses with 99% survival rates.
1	Because I want to keep myself and my family safe from the virus. Vaccine is important in order to discontinue or stop the spread of the covid virus.
0	And just like that the vax doesnt work.
1	vaccine is safe
1	I recently received the vaccine and I could not be more grateful to the scientists who developed it and the brave volunteers. Truly awe-inspiring. I TRUST SCIENCE.
1	Dear scientists, vaccine manufacturers, Belgian government officials and colleagues Thanks for the early Christmas booster present!
1	Omicron is a result of covid-19 tearing through an under-vaccinated country
0	2 problems I would like to point out with the numbers being skewed. 1 some people don't report their side affects and 2 there isn't a functional system that logs all these side effects.
0	That would be an atrocity, don’t make people take it! No to vaxx
1	When will the booster be available? I will gladly take it if they think it is necessary. I have been vaccinated for 7 months with absolutely no side effects.
1	Another Mail poster who didn't get his First Aid badge in the Scouts trhinks he knows more than the world's immunologists .
0	In the words of the great Stephen Hawkings: Rubbish.......
0	Oh the wonderful vaccines have saved us all, but wait...I never had any
1	It’s just utterly awesome that in just one year there are already many vaccines available. A huge triumph of science!!! And I also want to thank dr Campbell whose videos I have been watching, every day, since February 2020.
1	Imagine for 10 seconds LOL if we didn't have the brilliant scientists and Pfizer, Moderna, etc. and the vaccines.....I got the shot after waiting for enough data to feel OK, it is really the way out of this, plus public health measures, some that should continue on as good habits. Until you have been really sick and couldn't breathe, you can't really understand... we need to care a little more about each other and for our vulnerable, not just for ourselves.
1	yes to vaccines, stop being stupid
1	Thanks for this video. I got the Moderna three days ago. The only effect I've had is muscle ache. I'm due to get the second dose next month. I hear the second one's the toughest, so I'm nervous.
0	you have to be completely ignorant to think that some people do not get injured or even die from these vaccines. Everyone's body reacts differently just like with the virus itself. My friend nearly died after her 2nd dose of Pfizer. It's rare but it does happen.
0	This is no true. Hope to see all of the people in Norimberga. I lost both my parents after 20 days taking Covid vaccine. Yes no relationship
1	I got my second Pfizer dose on the 28th and today I can eat at all the restaurants in Portugal 🇵🇹 and be less scared for my family’s well being. All of us got vaccinated with Pfizer, Moderna and Jensen and we are all ok
0	what caring parents give their children a vaccine with unknown side effects. This is no were near the same scenario as polio or small pox.
0	Nervous system disorders following Covid vaccination are being recorded in shocking numbers, with reports to the UK’s Yellow Card Scheme of almost 300,000 injuries and 300 deaths. No one’s talking about them. We are.
0	I understand when people get the vaccine and then say "oh it was fine I didn't have any side effects" but what scares me is that there could be side effects that don't appear until much later and we haven't had enough time to test that... I don't want to be a guinea pig
1	I will take the vaccine. Safety in numbers!
1	If vaccines don't become mandatory this mess will never end!
0	I don’t trust the vaccines because they were developed quickly
0	Your body, your choice. The vaccine does not keep you from getting covid or spreading it.
1	This vaccine has been under development since SARS, about 20 years ago.  The information needs to be put out there by every network - it's not so 'brand new', and there has been significant testing.
1	I have had asthma since childhood, breathing is such an important part of staying alive. I am also hypopituitary since 2003 so I finally elected to receive the Pfizer due to myths vs. facts from my leading endocrinologist. Absolutely no side effects. My brother passed away June 26, 2021 at age 66. He developed pneumonia covid and it scarred his lungs and his kidneys failed. He was listening to the myths of the vaccine.
1	The vaccines are definitely an achievement for science and medicine! So sad how many conspiracies are being spread about it and people therefore fearing this vaccine to help us
0	Certainly not. I'm not going to do anything unless they force me to. On moral grounds, I will not take a vaccine that contains MRNA. I'm allergic to a few of the ingredients. Even a flu shot causes me to respond.
0	The fact that we don’t know what the vaccine will do to our bodies short term, much less long term, and they still want it mandated is outrageous.
1	the only silent war against humanity is the anti vaxxers trying to derail an attempt to fight a pandemic. Why on earth do people think it is right to not comply to social distancing which is helping minimise the spread, and use a vaccine to help with slowing down serious illness admissions to hospitals. That’s the real war on humanity you should be protesting about, yet some are too deluded and too dense to realise that
0	Hell with the vaccine I know a few people who have died from symptoms of the vaccine also think about long term effects of health of the vaccine..... think before getting the vaccine everyone
1	I already got my second dose. Thanks to this geniuses!!!!
0	I think we can all agree that giving up our bodily autonomy to heartless corporations and elected officials is a bad idea.
0	I do not trust any government or medical vaccine…I would rather build my immune system naturally as God intended. It's against my spiritual religion and my body is my responsibility in my life.
0	Nope! Not a chance. You blew that chance with the vaccine that doesn't work and the 3 boosters to follow
1	I live in London, and I’m wondering where you got your figures. Probably Fox News. Anyway, according to the Office of National Statistics, “in England, between 2 January and 2 July 2021, there were 51,281 deaths involving coronavirus (COVID-19); 640 occurred in people who were fully vaccinated, which includes people who had been infected before they were vaccinated. The risk of death involving COVID-19 was consistently lower for people who had received two vaccinations compared to one or no vaccination, as shown by the weekly age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) for deaths involving COVID-19.”
0	The real risk is reactogenicity, so it's going to hurt where they get the shot, and that's going to last a day or two,
1	So many  people suffering. As early as possible  release in market. Every day very important day. All of researchers congrats
0	My body my choice.
1	Vaccine + mask + social distancing = end to this if we can all do it!!
0	I have had SERIOUS menstrual issues since my Pfizer covid vaccine. I had my full 2 doses. 2 months after my second dose, I had the worst menstrual cycle of my life and I've been having a period for 24 years. I was bleeding twice as much, while passing blood clots the size of my fist. I've talked to other vaccinated women who had the same exact issues..or they stopped having a period altogether.
0	You can put whatever you want inside of me even someone else’s heart but I draw the line at COVID vaccinations
0	Concerns about safety are mostly covered in Phase 1, which was already completed. Remember, this vaccine isn’t a brand new concoction— it’s already been proven to be safe for humans as a MERS vaccine. They’ve simply tweaked it to confer immunity for COVID.
1	Are tory voters and anti vaxxers the same people . Both of them ignore the evidence right in front of their eyes
1	BEGONE ANTI-VAX FAR RIGHT
1	I got all three of my vaccines. I'm a senior and the effects were very mild.
0	Okey..if you’re not bias talk about natural immunity. I dare you
1	Many thanks for your excellent video, which has certainly reassured me! I'm in England and had my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine this morning.
1	Even if it were true that vaccines might give children autism *eye roll* it's astonishing how many people would rather have their children die of disease than possibly develop autism.
1	Here in tanzania I lost many relatives myself cause of the pandemic even recently despite the government denying covid many ppls familys have been affected by it very badly
0	The risks outweigh the benefits in the age group. The disparity is enormous, do not do this to your children.
1	Only reason my mom is getting it is because her job is making her. Oh well. Atleast she’s finally going to be vaccinated.
0	The boosters are just as ineffective and dangerous as the first three.
0	There's most likely something horrible in these shots if they're trying to compel everyone to take it.
1	Hopfully everyone will take it
0	Yep. I'm not activated, I'm anti covid vax.
0	Every day I grow more grateful making the decision to not get the shots!
0	endless vaccines. great business.
1	I also have an immune system, mine is better prepared to tackle COVID-19 because I’ve been #vaccinated
0	Greed is the ultimate drug.. nothing is more addicting that money
1	Vaccines are certainly a lot less experimental then a novel virus. And why do all similar anti-vaxxers hang their hat on morgue figures as if that is the only possible long term complication from infection?
1	Wonderful news. Now if only the children in this country have parents who are intelligent enough to get them vaccinated.
1	Many countries worldwide have approved to use it because it has a 95 % effective rate . Come on , you know it's TRUE Have a nice day Sincerely from the AWESOME revolution
0	I'll pass on this vaccine too.
1	Yay, they finally got a vaccine
0	I’ll gladly sit this one out and wait for herd immunity
0	Don't worry, big pharma has full immunity from lawsuits.
1	Has anyone tried turning the anti-vaxxers off and turning them back on again
1	so you don’t trust doctors and epidemiologists who study this stuff for a living?! ️ If they get it I’m sure it’s fine. Remember, if you get COVID you can be asymptomatic but the virus can still do a lot of damage to your heart and other organs. So if you’re heart muscle is weakened you’re 10x more likely to have a complication from the yearly flu or even a cold. And it may be easier for you to get pneumonia as well.
1	it had one of the largest sample sizes in history. So no, it was not untested.
1	Death is not the only side effect. The point of a vax is NOT to JUST reduce death. The point is to totally reduce the bad effects of covid, free hospitals to treat sick, avoid infecting immune suppressed or vulnerable. It’s no different than any vaccine.
0	My friend was injured from the vaccine, his doctor refused to treat him and admit it was the vax
0	Well done Kate for speaking the truth. It's unbelievable how many people thought this jab was safe and are now dead.
0	JESUS IS THE ONLY VACCINE I NEED
0	I recommend cough medicine. It works better.
1	I got both doses last year. For the first shot, my arm was just sore for a day. The second dose was a little bit unpleasant. Had a slight fever and runny nose for a day, but after that I was alright again. Till now I haven’t gotten sick, so that’s good! Stay safe everyone!
0	They DO NOT WORK! PFIZER does NOT work. period
0	If vaccines are so safe? Just ask the question then "why did congress give pharmaceutical companies blanket immunity? "
0	I have taken every vaccines of various dieseases as prescribed age wise since childhood. But looking at numerous unreported side effects after vaccination in India, I am feeling tensed and skeptical about this one.
1	I felt rough for a few days after the vaccine, but I'd take it all day long before having Covid. My friend who fell ill with Covid before he could get the vaccine is going through hell. In his words he's existing in between coughing.
1	Seriously each and everyone must take vaccination as early as possible.This is the only way to control the covid.
0	At this point, those of us who have chosen not to be vax’d, will gladly raise our middle thinger until the very end. There is not a single thing you or anyone else can do to change that aside from war, you ready?
1	the vaccines work excellently at preventing hospitalization and severe disease
1	I can't wait to have mine, prevention is better than cure
0	Is your magnetised arm from the vaccine now permanently attached to the car as well ... we can only hope.
0	Let the vaccinated know that now vaxxed they have the equivalent of hiv and cannot donate there plasma..
0	Heart Inflammation cases reported from covid-19 vaccines in Australia in only 2 days. 44 cases, 29 of those under the age of 40. One case aged 15 (female) this is unforgivable
1	The vaccines can help prevent serious illness and death. I will take it as soon as possible.
1	Get vaccinated and get ours as well . For yourselves !
1	PLEASE get vaccines
1	Just got my first dose here in India.
0	I’ll protect myself from not taking the vaccine, thanks
1	COVID-19 vaccines are being monitored for safety with the most comprehensive and intense safety monitoring program in U.S. history.
0	I am NOT getting vaccinated against this virus. I’ll build my own immunity thanks.
0	Currently pregnant and I will not take it now or after my baby comes.
1	It's sad to see the other side of the coin with this issue. It's also sad that the least well informed as also in many cases, the ones who are least equipped financially to cope (in the US at least).  In the countries where my family live (Australia and Japan), we're seeing the reverse. We have very high uptakes of the vaccine (currently around the 95% of all over 16 years old). Cases are coming back down, hospital rates are plummeting and life is getting back to normal. Hospitals are getting free ICU beds and resources are there to do elective surgery. The public is more confident to see their doctors and enter emergency rooms for other types of emergencies. Something as simple are regular check ups allowing for the detection of cancers for example, is now starting to occur at regular levels.  The vaccine is really the solution to the problem.  What might feel like a rushed, untested, experimental vaccine to some in this video is possibly borne out of not understand the processes required. With global research bringing together decades or work, short cutting of the bureaucratic portions of testing and overlapping of phases of testing, this vaccine has been fortunate to have an accelerated path through a normal but just as thorough testing regime.  In light of new variants such as Delta and now Omicron, it's certainly better to provide our immune systems some preparatory immunity than to be open to natural attack in the hope that one can recover naturally - as we have seen, exposing oneself to this beast of a virus.
0	No mask, no vaccine, alive and feeling fine.
0	The vaccinated population in the UK account for nearly 75% of alleged Covid-19 deaths, according to the UK Health Security Agency.
0	It’s Not A Booster It’s The 4th Shot Of A Product That Already Failed Three Times
1	Usually I am very empathetic and caring. I have no sympathy for stupidity. The crazy theorys the spread. “If I only knew”, they say while in intensive care. They were told over and over.
0	I'm at doctor now and he was pretty pushy about getting vaccine. I just said,I'm here for my blood pressure meds. He almost convinced me.
0	How wow, I’m so scared. Let me just go get my 10th booster and I will become immortal.
1	The mother truckers drove across Canada and showed why they need to be vaccinated. Their industry can transport COVID across North America.
1	I know people who have had covid 3x and they still refuse to get the vaccine but complain on how sick they are. ???? Like bro just get it
1	More bad news for the anti vaxxers
1	I will take my vaccines to protect my family
0	Words don't do justice to how grateful I am to have come across you, you're genuine and humble and you help to translate scientific jargon into simple and easy to understand language. I hope you see this and can possibly help me, I'm at a fork in the road of what to do, either get the vaccine or go with natural immunity. A brief overview about myself, I'm 34 years old, 5 ft 10 inches tall, and 85 kg. Australian aboriginal, eat vegan, go gym, and am in overall great health, no serious health issues, just very basic health issues that we can get throughout our lives, and easily eventually get over. Once again, thank you ! You've earned a subscriber. Finally, I'm surprised in a good way, the civil discourse in this comment section, I feel comfortable in this community, thanks !
1	You can still die in a car accident while wearing a seat belt. Therefore I wont wear my seatbelt anymore. Logic
1	99% of the deaths are from people that dont vaccinate. That sounds like working VERY well to me
0	If you get a vaccine you don’t have to buy an antenna for your tv, you are one.
0	My Sister in law had 2 blood clots & a stroke 5 days after the Astra vaccine.  She’s recovering now but couldn’t walk or talk for a month
1	The vaccine works. Problem is 1/3 of Americans have been duped by anti-vax propaganda so the current daily death rates are at the 2nd highest peak of the whole pandemic. Sad.
0	There is never ever a reason for Government to FORCE any citizen to take a medical treatment.
0	I wish I could not have taken vaccine like Dr James. I feel mandating vaccine is wrong. Some countries treating unvaccinated as untouchables! where is the world going?
1	Jab me as soon as it’s available, no brainer
1	Not convinced by the French data? Look at the positive impact of #COVID19 vaccination in Switzerland
0	My arm still hurts from that shot.. And It's never been the same..
0	This will be looked back on 20 years from now as a sick experiment
1	I really wish there were more informative articles like this in order to fight with facts against all that misinformation that has invaded the Internet and Social Networks.
0	It is not a vaccine it is gene therapy. I totally agree with vaccines but this has not had all clinical trials including animal testing. Long term affects could be serious
0	The television fools you. Vaccines are death.
1	Biden should start  sending vaccines to Mexico and to other countries since people don’t want to that way maybe slow the virus around
1	Be a part of something good for all. Who wants themselves or anyone else at risk of feeling sick and fearful
0	A vaccine is meant to fuck you up, that’s what the science says!
0	Until its proven theres no side effects years later there should rightfully be doubt.
0	Should people be forced to give up natural immunity that’s been around for millions of years and costs nothing or become dependent on a for profit drug company that has only been around 100 years and makes billion dollar mistakes that kill people?
0	I'm unvaccinated. I'm not anti-vax. I just believe in choice.
0	This people are the reason botlle that says POISON also needs to say DONT DRINK. idiots are literally trusting facebook posts more than doctors and scientists
1	Yes, you can still get Covid but people who have been vaccinated have a much lower incidence for death and hospitalization.
1	I’m gonna get vaccinated in like an hour wish me luck
1	I don’t believe in mandating the vaccine but for Christ’s sake just get vaccinated. It may not prevent you from getting ill but it will keep you out of the ICU and out of the fucking morgue.
0	What has happened to people? This is inhumane. Totally sickening, we are talking about a jab for a virus with a 99.97% recovery rate and an IFR the same as flu, not the plague! It certainly is NOT about the jab but about complete control of the plebs.
0	To all my unvaxxed brethren out there: HOLD THE LINE!!!
1	Don't let your child be next. Vaccinate.
1	And THIS is why I love science and technology...
1	got fully vaccinated. Then after a month i got covid hehe... Still thankful for being vaccinated. I have a lot of medical problems that is respiratory related in my previous years such an bronchitis and pneumonia. If i haven't gotten any vaccine. I may have severe symptoms. Luckily i was just classified as asymptomatic when i got covid.
1	Thank you, Dr.  Not coughing; but head and body aches.  Instant test can catch it AFTER 24 hours. I'm vaccinated, but I hear we have it, too (San Diego, California, USA) and that's helpful information.  So far, everyone here that caught Omicron is only mildly sick, hope it stays that way.  We're usually looking for cough and fever, not head and body pain. I appreciate the heads up South Africa on different symptoms to look for.  Very happy that vaccine companies are sending doses your way.  We are in this together.
1	I got the vaccine, both doses, as soon as I possibly could. Why? My dad died four years ago at the age of 83. I got it because I want to live as long as possible (a selfish notion, I know).
0	Trudeau and pro-vaccine people said they wanted to make life as difficult as possible for non-vaxers. They also angered those who felt forced to have their doses. These irresponsible idiots have sown the wind, now they will reap the social and political storm.
0	Let us see the side effects, if it is SO SAFE. If not stop pushing
1	Got my second dose yesterday and I’m sore from it, but it’s definitely worth it to protect my grandparents!
0	Correct me if I'm wrong, but even Pfizer has said their vaccine is not effective against Omicron. So... why are we still pushing the jab? Oh, yes. I forgot. $$$$$
0	So many adverse affects and reports of death after vaccination.  Long term prospects look even worse.
0	Boosters are showing to be counterproductive, which is why many countries are dropping them. Vax immunity runs out relatively quickly, "requiring a booster to maintain immunity". So what is the point of it all?. Maybe we should just stop the insanity that's not working.
0	If you’re young and healthy you have a 99.98% chance of surviving, and there’s already been bad side effects for two of the vaccines. Don't take it, folks!
0	There needs to be open debate and disemination of information. The broken trust is what needs to be addressed.
0	Covid will just disappear so no vax
0	This is a world without one vaccine...
1	It would be pretty stupid for them to roll out an unsafe vaccine to the entire military... if they force armed services to take this vaccine, itll be because its proven safe. They're not going to risk it.
0	It has more deaths then all other vaccines combined in less then 1 year.
0	Desperate times call for desperate measures. The jabs and jab pushers are the evil ones.
0	Vaccinated people are feeling bad that nothing bad is happening to unvaccinated people so they want to put fear in them so that they also become vaccinated in case there negative consequences with the vaccine
0	It’s better getting Covid
1	I just crossed 6 months since I got my 2 shots and also the 3rd shot booster. I am at a loss if I need another. I ve called the COVID hotline, pharmacies, and the Dept of Health. Only reply from all of them is that is a good question .
0	I'm not an anti vaxxer (my husband, child and I have had all our vaccines) but I feel this vaccine has been rushed out and I don't trust it.
1	It's totally safe to take the vaccine though guys.
0	"I feel so liberated"…while we all still wear masks and need monthly vaccine boosteds
1	I'm glad they found a covid 19 vaccine but I'm also sad because school will open again
1	I personally just got over having Covid and have pretty bad asthma and I am so thankful that I had the vaccine because I know it would’ve been much more serious if I didn’t. I still had terrible effects and I’m still dealing with the aftermath but I know if I didn’t have the vaccine it would’ve been even worse.
0	If you were made to believe that you could vaccinate your way out of covid.. ..you were misinformed.
0	This anchor is completely clueless 🙄..Bravo Dr.....Kay u can have his share n mine share of the vaccine. all urs n ur family
0	Nobody knows how safe it is! That’s the big punchline! Get it? Wake the F up people!
1	Require the vaccine for all travel !!! all forms of travel !!
1	yeah if I was in that situation where I'd need to be vaccinated to visit a dying relative or somehting no matter how antivaxx someone is I feel like they'd get vaccinated
1	I am over 60 and caught Covid a couple of weeks ago. Mild flu symptoms for three days (bad headache and very painful throat), then got better. Fully vaccinated and boosted. So thankful for the vaccine.
1	The purpose of getting a vaccine is not to protect yourself. It's to protect your community. If a vaccine comes out and is safe, I will take it. It's the least I can do to help my country out of this crisis.
1	If people want to live some kind of normality without masks, absolutely. But cry babies will be cry babies and always get their way.
0	And please do tell me how the vaccine works... because it sure as hell isn’t working what so ever. Prevents severe disease?
0	COVID-19 is a mild disease and not dangerous
0	I am still not fully 100% sure that these vaccines are necessary.
1	Like terrorists, they spread fear and terror. Not only on the Internet or on Telegram, where they talk about "lethal injection" and give free rein to their violent fantasies, even planning murders.
1	Most people i know are conservative. Everyone I know has the vaccine.
1	The way that these mRNA vaccines work is so freakin cool. The scientists developing this vaccination tech did some seriously groundbreaking work. We’re living in the future.
1	Boosted!  #BoosterDose
0	More vaxx damage than serious Covid illnesses. About 4:1 ratio.
0	I know many people who got vaxed and still got covid this is pathetic
0	Do they expect to get reelected after so shamelessly imposing these vaccines?
1	Had both Pfizer shots. Barely noticeable symptoms. Glad I got vaccinated !
1	I transferred to Ms in the 8th grade and my shot records was missing. I had to get vaccinated all over again. My kids turned out fine, and I just had my first grandchild. All vaccinated
0	Interesting how hard this shot is being pushed. Raises red flags. Doctors warning against it are being canceled. Major red flag. Love that she says she has the right to question. Yes!
1	Me and my coworkers in the hospital will be finally able to get vaccinated. Leaving your home everyday to go to work knowing that you can get infected anytime is very scary, since we are running low on PPE. I'm tired mentally and physically and last month we had a meeting that we had to prepare for a next wave! Oh God when is this going to end?!!!
0	Tell em youve already been vaccinated and its a violation of HIPPA laws if they tell you you to prove... I make my own HCQ with grapefruit and lemons why aren't you? https://t.co/5Srxn9sGRl
0	Don't worry...if another variant shows up we can make a new vaccine that will be just as ineffective as the one we have now!   No problem!   Give us money.
1	97% of the people currently hospitalized with COVID-19 are unvaccinated. 97%. But yeah, you should totally avoid the vaccine because it might magnetize you or cause you to become Satan's plaything. Fuck herd immunity. This is Darwinism. Survival of the smartest.
0	They really want to get rid of people don't they.
1	Getting a vaccine doesn't weaken your immune system. And you got the flu? Congratulations. You are amongst a few people worldwide. The flu almost completely disappeared.
1	People who refuse a life saving vaccine are just plain stupid.
1	vaccines work. Read a biology book perhaps you need some help with the basics.
0	There will never be a cure because they don't want to make a cure. They won't end the cash cow.
0	show me the evidence. there is no long term safety data, so if you are claiming they are “safe” you are talking out of your ass with no evidence to support your claim. The best you can say is “they seem safe short term, we don’t know long term” because you don’t!
1	If you ever said, "Jesus is my vaccine," check into a church—not a hospital—when you get sick.
1	I've had second dose of covid vaccine yesterday and you know what? I'm still perfectly alive and healthy, unlike my mom's friend who died from covid when she wasn't even old.
0	Covid 19 vaccine is more dangerous, it stays in body for two weeks only because they are weaker after two weeks you can be positive again
1	I’ve gotten 2 vaccine shots and I’m perfectly fine, I won’t listen to influencers like that. Also, I’ll still be wearing my mask just to be on the safe side.
1	At first I was in the position to reject vaccination because I was worried and in the state of anxiety however I decided to be vaccinated if it is Pfizer or Moderna, thanks God I have done with 2 doses of Modernna and I am very confident after being vaccinated. Vaccination is a great help in terms of our health and safety. Do our part be vaccinated!
1	Get vaccinated everyone and provide your friends who may be hesitant with accurate information instead of ridiculing them
1	Get the booster if you haven’t already! You need more t-cells!!
0	I didn't need the shot because my perfectly functional immune system sorted the issue out for me
1	Dr. Li Wenliang - when I heard he has passed away from the disease that was killing people, we would be in for the long haul. Bless him and his family! The pandemic is not over! #GetVaccinated
0	F rite off with all your vaccines, i'm not interested.
1	People of all religions who use their brains agree on taking vaccinations to save lives!
1	I just got my vaccine! No side effects as of yet!
1	Of course everyone should be mandated to take all the vaccines ! Crazy world
1	I got my vaccine last year on November. And then I was fully Vaccinated. Yes I did got somewhat sick but it got better again. Same with the second one. But it sucks that I end up getting covid because of my brother who got it from work. but he didn't get vaccine.. he had it worse.. and am surprised he still alive.. me and my daughter is fully Vaccinated. But we end up getting covid. Ya I didn't get sick I did get medication and my daughter got slight sick but not dangerous. it's been hard for the both of us.. but we are staying home. People should be Vaccinated.. it well save your life.
0	Yeah completely safe after two failed shots with promises and mandates... It doesn't work.
1	I got the vaccine to protect the people around me and you should too.
0	@philipsorensen @Travistritt @wellbeyondphoto Vaxxed people spread COVID, you are a segregationist bigot.
0	It doesn't matter! Stop f**** with freedom of choice. If we feel vaccinations are horseshit then just leave us alone and we'll deal with it. If you all want to stick your kids with this poison that's your prerogative. Vaccinations simply are not needed.
1	I love that 36% of respondents said they would be LESS inclined to get the vaccine if Trump says it’s safe
1	I am praying you both take the vaccine! It's the best thing I have done so far!
1	What is their problem with taking vaccine?
0	The unknown long term side effects makes me nervous.
0	Immune serums are the real providers of help to the immune system.Vaccines today are just pure neurotoxic substances causing all kind of irreversible damage.
1	Vaccines are an incredible thing and I'm grateful that we have them
0	Don't let ur children to take covid vaccine! Pls! Have pity on them!
1	The bad news: The virus that causes COVID-19 is able to infect the same person multiple times. The good news: You have a better chance at fighting it after each exposure or vaccine dose.
1	At least we have a vaccine so the pandemic so about to end.
1	All vaccines in the country are safe for use!!!
0	A hoax can't make you sick though.
1	Yes we need to vaccinate our children.
0	With this amount of people, that potential for unknown side-effects could be magnified with a larger sample size (with obviously a larger range of health states), and become noticeable.
1	Many say they don't know what's in the vaccine. I tell them that it's the same with Coke and that it doesn't stop them from drinking it.
1	When I think that some people still question the effectiveness of vaccination If we had the contamination figures with Omicron without vaccines, it would be a hecatomb… Vaccines save lives, and prevent severe forms of the disease, including in children
1	I'm scheduled to get my first shot this Friday! Yay!!
1	Looking forward to getting vaccinated and getting back to normal.
1	100% pro-vaccine, 100% anti-vaccine mandates. I personally do not plan on taking the vaccine however, I understand why people do/don't.
0	Only 1% of people died. Survival rate is 99.99%  Why are they forcing the injections? I BEG YOU, wake up, PEOPLE. It is getting so scary.  They clearly want to hurt all of us and ruin this world eventually
0	When you do the proper math from just wosconsin numbers alone its less than .09%. I will take those odds.
0	Israel abolishes its health pass as Omicron also infects vaccinated people, says health ministry director. @olivierveran keeps the vaccine pass to piss off the unvaccinated. Electoral scandal
1	The virus smuggles RNA into our cells in exactly the same way as the mRNA vaccines. Only in large quantities the entire viral genome instead of well-dosed and only a single RNA strand. Whatever harm could conceivably be done by RNA vaccination, we have much more to fear from the virus. I'll get vaccinated at the first opportunity.
0	Biggest scam on earth
1	In other news, once again vaccine prove their positive uses and anti-vaxxers sacrifice themselves to prove that they are wrong. Again.
1	When you get a vaccine it’s a less severe form of Covid 19 that lets your body produce antibodies for it so if you ever do come into contact with someone who has Covid you will be able to fight it off I’m pretty sure
0	I personally know two people that had serious side effects after the second Jab. That's enough doing my own studies. One got a lung blood clot That was resolved with medicine thanks God. Both are still alive
0	They will be vaccinated with saline in front of all people. They will think these are real vaccines.
1	Thank you for creating this video. It's very frustrating to read all the anti vaccine comments all over the internet. Even here in Switzerland, where we supposedly have very good general education there's an alarming rise of people spreading misinformation.
1	I dont know anything about viruses, that is why I am trusting the scientists and taking the vaccine next month
0	Vaccine is dangerous !
0	Antibodies and other components of the immune system remember invaders, helping protect against further infection.
1	I took the same vaccine but I had only high fever for the next day and it ended the next morning, but I had pain in my hand for a week After the second dose nothing happened to me except only a minor pain in the area of injection I also never heard anything worse happening to anyone I know or people around me
1	She's much better fighting Orcs and Trolls than medical science. Using her bow and arrows to shoot down the plain truth of vaccines is sad misuse of her fighting skills as an elf.
1	lets just vaccinate the ones with compromised immune system
0	So what if I already had COVID-19, got vaccinated afterwards, got COVID-19 again, got the booster at the start of this year and got COVID-19 again last week. I didn't really feel a difference in the severity of the disease before and after vaccination. Actually, getting boosted triggered a worse immune response than when I first got sick without vaccine enhanced immunity or the COVID-19 infection from last week. I assume the lack of severity of the last infection was because of the recent booster, but there's still my first infection (probably when the first variant was around because there was no talk about other variants at the time) that wasn't as bad as the immune response. At this rate, I don't think I want to get another booster because I sincerely think I "have enough immunity already" and the spread doesn't really seem to slow down (variants, supposedly over time decrease of vaccine enhanced immunity).
0	Personally, I understand not getting the Covid vaccine as I won’t be getting it either. My concern lies with how new it is and that no long term affects would be ascertainable.  My friend of many years recently received a fairly new anti STD Vaccine, and after a week she lost all usage of her legs from the shot. Why? Because not everyone’s body responds the same to a foreign matter being injected into them.  As for those saying I’m doing harm to myself and others by not getting it, well respectfully, you can all shove it. It’s my body, I'll be responsible for my own health, and if I get it, so be it. I’m young and realistically I'll most likely fight it, and move on with my life. Plus the only ‘old’ people I'm in proximity too are my parents who are in their late forties and will also not be taking it.
1	Proud to have taken the vaccine early on. I'm 99% sure there won't be any bad effects but even if there is, I'm okay with being an important part of the advance of medicine. Millions have died before us that we have learned from. There are always risks in this life. If you're worried about risking the vaccine, then you should be worried about getting covid, or drinking, or being overweight, or making left hand turns. We constantly take measured risks, and the payout of a safe vaccine is worth the small amount of risk.
1	Don't call yourself a servant of the country if you refuse to vaccinate in a pandemic. I wish we could send all the anti vaxxers to their own land with their own hospitals so they can't drain the us healthcare system
1	got fully vaccinated. Then after a month i got covid hehe... Still thankful for being vaccinated. I have a lot of medical problems that is respiratory related in my previous years such an bronchitis and pneumonia. If i haven't gotten any vaccine. I may have severe symptoms. Luckily i was just classified as asymptomatic when i got covid.
1	There’s so much wrong with your view. Firstly, a virus is contagious believe it or not. Secondly, vaccines protect others as it weakens the virus when it infects you and spreads onto others.
0	There is nothing god cant protect you from , a million vaccines cant even compare
1	My 77 year old mother had mild symptoms from the vaccine. She had a breakthrough case in August and didn't have to be hospitalized. She quarantined for two weeks and all good. I'm certain we would have lost her had she not been vaccinated.
0	“The vaccine should be tested on politicians first. If they survive, the vaccine is safe.  If they don’t, then the country is safe.” —Monika Wisniewska
1	First coronavirus vaccine shots given in U.S. Thank you Mr. President!
1	Oh wow, in places where >90% of adults are vaxxed, somehow the vaxxed COVID numbers barely exceed the unvaxxed COVID numbers! Who would’ve thought that’s how math works?!
0	Straight EVIL..Trust in the Healing Powers of the ALLMIGHTY..Build your Immune System Brothers and Sisters and Stay Informed
1	Why is Rupert Murdoch, one of the first to get vaccinated, allowing anti-science BS on the air? It is killing people.
0	I experienced a Major Heart Attack 16 days after my second Pfizer Covid Vaccine shot. I am scared to get the Booster shot. My Cardiologist advised me NOT to get the Booster shot. So far I am following her advice.
0	Experimental- I an not being paid by big pharma to be their lab rat. I also don’t want aborted fetal cells injected into my body. What an abomination
0	My family had Covid over Christmas 4 of us two nearly 60 and two around thirty all recovered and not vaccinated
1	Would be terrible to think that these "tribes" of anti vaxxers are having their beliefs reinforced by people employed to create anti vaccination posts and memes etc.
1	The reality is that if you are vaccinated Covid poses less risk to you than the flu if you are not in one of the high risk groups
1	So the vaccine is what is saving us, and it is the only thing that is saving us. Holy fuck. This is a major historical moment.
0	Which parent wants to risk their teen son to risk of myocarditis with unknown long term potential heart condition. With the near less than 2 % of teens getting infectious COVID cases being , very , very low. Unless something we don’t know yet.
0	They are not anti vaxxers..They are strong free willed people with immune systems. Love to them all ️ Sydney Australia
0	Check out the New Zealand study where the total deaths track the vaccination rate. NZ is a great population to see what's going on. The locked down and nearly 100% vaccinations, yet still they have had many deaths that correlate to the vaccinations. That says volumes!
1	I got vaccinated to protect my family & because it aligns with my values to contribute to society in a positive & collaborative way, protect our weakest & because its the only way this becomes an endemic. It takes a village of empathetic citizens.
1	Vaccination , Booster Included ,mask and distancing..plus washing hands very often..only solution And still lot of people Don't get it!!
1	Yes, vaccines are not 100% foolproof. Neither are antibiotics. Most medicines do not give you an entire guarantee that they will not prevent weakness under all circumstances. The point is that they help you.
1	I finally got my dad who's been a smoker of 50 years to get his first shot last week... He only did it because we haven't been talking much since I moved and he realized I only asked because i loved him.
1	I have CHF, Type 2 Diabeties, Hashimotos. I had J&;J my first shot and Pfizer my second shot, ZERO ISSUES with the vaccine. Unvaxxed people I work with are getting covid and 1 person has died from covid, I haven't got covid, vaccines work.
1	Small price to pay, considering the overall benefits of the vaccine
0	I’m afraid that the COVID vaccine will kill me or damage me in some way that will make life not worth living. I don’t feel “icky” about the ingredients, I feel sheer terror
0	Make no mistake— the Biden regime wants people to die. They have now blocked every harmless treatment or therapy that people claimed saved their lives. It’s vaccine or die. And many times, vaccine AND die.
1	Publicize that unvaccinated patients will be charged a premium for medical services. At this point obstinacy is  willful stupidity.
1	I was vaccinated, then I caught COVID-19, it was a couple of hours with a sneeze, and cough, I was better in a week!
1	Opposition to vaccination has posed a challenge to herd immunity, allowing preventable diseases to persist in or return to populations with inadequate vaccination rates.
1	The vaccine did a good job. I hope your parents get well soon.
1	I look forward to getting my vaccination
0	I’m never getting vaccinated
1	Get the vaccine, it works and stop doing useless stuff. It erodes the trust in the science.
0	Well I still don’t know or met anyone who’s caught this virus
1	Vaccines reduce the likelihood of infection. Then they also reduce the likelihood of spreading it if infected. Not saying I agree or disagree with vax passports, but thats why.
1	I felt rough for a few days after the vaccine, but I'd take it all day long before having Covid. My friend who fell ill with Covid before he could get the vaccine is going through hell. In his words he's existing in between coughing.
1	Only wakners refuse vaccinations, they are a menace to societ
0	The woman with the purple bonnet, Ms.Maxine, is speaking volumes as to why many will not get the vaccine. Literally word for word- is what I am hearing from many in my community. I do hope she is better.
1	People..get vaccinated!!! You are keeping this going!!!!
0	WE WONT COMPLY TO THIS DEVIL JUICE OF A VACCINE!!!
1	The vaccine made up of already tested vaccine and a combination of different vaccine that why they was able to get it passed, which is more than they do to medication you buy off the shelf.
0	Your body has its own immune system. Let it do its job. If you're healthy you should be fine. Why do I want to put some man made concoction in my body. SMH
1	My issue with no vaxers is not what they do for themselves, I could not care less. The problem is that they are occupying a lot of the beds that should go to cancer patients.
1	because the vacine doesnt prevent TRANSMISSION. it just means you are less likely to die from covid. unfortunately once people get the vaccine they get careless and allow covid to transmit among vaccinated allowing the virus to mutate and eventually beat the vaccine
1	If vaccines are so important and their risk so outweighed by their benefit, then the government should rely on that argument and persuade people to get vaccines
1	Got my first vac today. I have to wait 3 wks for the second vac. Glad I'm getting it done. No more worries! 🙂👍
1	Im just happy to actually see a light at the end of the tunnel. It’s been a very long, painful year...we’re not out of the woods yet but seeing things like this just alleviates a lot of anxiety and depression.
0	I want to know WHY I should get the vaccine. Not why someone else wants me to get the vaccine. If I don’t get the vaccine, I’m possible to spread to others, I understand. But if they don’t want to get vaccinated, that’s their fault.. right? I’m totally okay and willing to be sick with COVID-19. So can someone give me a reasonable reason why I should get the vaccine? I’ve been asking all my friends but there’s really no logic in their answers. But I’m truly wanting some good answers. My reason I don’t want the vaccine: I don’t think it’s truly ready to be used yet. It could cause me more harm than actual COVID-19. And I’m personally not scared of getting sick at all.
1	It is mind blowing how she said she don’t know what’s in it - I’m pretty sure she doesn’t know what’s in most of the stuff she consumes on a daily.
1	Incredibly grateful to have received my first COVID19 vaccine dose today!!
0	Same here. I'm not proud, per se. It's just nobody's business to coerce me into getting a shot. I initially rejected the vaccines due to scientific concerns, but now it's purely a matter of principle. I'm not taking the shots simply because I don't trust the people who push for them.
0	Are you still alive? Why take a vaccine for an imaginary virus?
0	Everyone has rights not to take part in an experimental vaccine programme !!
1	You have to admit that our doctors are very talented Mash'Allah. Let's trust them and continue to raise awareness. I will try to find the vaccine with my team in shaa Allah.
1	all we can hope for is a broad spectrum vaccine to be developed over the next few years if possible
0	Herd immunity to me is a delegation of one's responsibility of his wellbeing to others. That's basically what it is; regardless if a drug works or not. And that's insanity at its finest point having someone to blame others for his immune being grounded. It's unbelievable.
0	Any parent that vax their kids is sick in the head.
1	Here is a great reason to get vaccinated. Long Covid otherwise known as Post Covid Syndrome or Long Haul Covid doesn’t go away. I got Covid in March of 2020 and have been almost completely incapacitated for 22 months now. It would be wonderful if you made a similar short documentary on the people not getting better for years.
0	My body, my Choice is my reason to not get the covid shot. I'm not obligated to explain myself
1	I’m from Arkansas, working in the ICU and this is very true about patients not wanting to believe that they have COVID and refuse the vaccine. It’s frustrating.
0	There is a mass cover up by the government and medical bodies where they say the deaths weren’t caused by the vaccine. But when you have lost 14 friends to that evil vaccine, you know for sure there are no coincidences going on here
1	I love you pfizer
0	We don’t care how you made this stuff we’re not taking it!
1	At the end of the day, the vaccine is safe. We've seen enough evidence pointing to the fact that it is and little evidence pointing to the fact that it isn't. Going on the anti vaxx hill is not something republicans should fight on.
1	so in order of importance. 1- fire 2- the wheel 3- tv remote 4- vaccines.
1	My 11yr old nephew had COVID in November, now +ve again. My bro just reminded me he’s unvaccinated as not eligible. I do really worry about repeated exposure of our kids to a virus that causes multi-system disease. When oh when will JCVI make a decision about vaccinating <12s?
0	Do these even work? I feel like everyone I know has already been infected no matter whether they got jabbed or not.
0	Hell with the vaccine I know a few people who have died from symptoms of the vaccine also think about long term effects of health of the vaccine..... think before getting the vaccine everyone .Plz
0	I'm still not going to take no shot, what Joe don't understang, God got me.
0	I don't know anyone who died of covid, but two of my friends were executed with the vax.
1	Companies had been working on mRNA flu vax for some time. They were nearly done then COVID hit, and they quickly switched it over to be for COVID instead. The mRNA vaccines also passed both animal and human trials before being distributed.
1	It is proven that the vaccine prevents catastrophic illness and death. Trudeau may have saved you and/or your family and friends.
0	"Feeling great prior to booster shot. Had injection at 1:30. Around 8 pm that evening had tachycardia and was in atrial fibrillation as confirmed on ECG."
1	Got my first vac today. I have to wait 3 weeks for the second vac. Glad I'm getting it done. No more worries!
1	FINALLY A VACCINE YAY!!!!
0	How did humanity survive for thousands of years with out drug and vaccines ? We hear so much ABOUT facts and science and so such a reductionist few of food and nutrition. I eat sugar free, fat free, and sodium free.......I'm vegan.....what ever your preference. ...what about the FACT WHEN IT COMES TO VIRUSES WE MOSTLY DEAL WITH  COMPUTER DRIVEN GENETIC  MODEL VOID OF A ACTUAL ISOLATED VIRUS (Koch's Postulate) model computer driven FORMULATIONS SPLIT SPLICED, THEORIES  ABOUND. VIROLOGY LACKS BIOLOGY.......[COMPUTER IMAGES]- not science  vs  ACTUAL SPECIES, LIVING ORGANISM AND VIRUSES. Science lost its way in the 1950 biology dead end no money in it. Big switch genetics....Genome Project- failure no cures only a huge "Industry"-drugs, cosmetics, nutritional marketing all bases on a single cell single disease "theory". It sells and that's all that matter we are no healthier today than 25 years ago.....war on cancer.....all these quote autoimmune disease-another new model new drugs new vaccines in the works. 1950s 6% of children had a chronic disease 1980's 12% chronic disease...today it's nearing 60%.... 1 in 4 adults are on medication. We rank 34th infant mortality under 5.    So so sad.  IM  DRUG  FREE  AND  VACCINE  FREE.
0	The mainstream media's fear has no effect on me. I've developed natural immunity
1	Just got mine today, Pfizer , no symptoms at all 😊
0	Trust me more people who are vaccinated wont recommend getring vaccinated
0	It is a joke that people still believe in the vaccines. This is a business and we are a clients. Vaccines make as perfect clients, infinite shots useless vaccines $$$ good for the pharmaceutical companies
0	Will it actually provide a high level of immunity though?
1	GUYS AT MY SCHOOL I CONVINCED AN ANTI VAXXER THAT THEY WERE WRONG BY USING FACTS AND LOGIC AND THEY ARE NOW PRO VAX but they’re still scared of the needle :/
0	Just another crap to cover up on why high number of infections come from vaccinated people
0	People will wake up against mandatory vaccinations but I worry it will be too late…
0	How long until they admit it doesn’t work, and tell you all the serious cancer like causing side effects.
0	Anytime someone has to "bribe" you into doing anything, you automatically know that something is wrong
0	Something about this vaccine that makes me feel uneasy idk why
1	Those who won’t have the vaccine need to justify their selfishness act in some way. Some of them convince themselves it’s bad; others want to think they’re somehow more clever than “the sheeple” because they’ve taken a few vitamins.
1	For me personally I'd be far more convinced by a person who presents data than a person who presents personal anecdotes.
1	I already got my vaccine and getting my second dose in mid January. hoping 2021 is a better year for all of us.
1	I’ve had mine for 3 weeks now. Perfectly fine
1	mRNA vaccines have been researched for over 20 years, the vaccines have been fully tested.
0	All of these people must be held accountable for their crimes against humanity
1	As a nurse, I would have zero problem delivering the message that they're out of luck. We have a solution. Freaking use it.
0	Get the booster so you can ...what?  Still get the cold? Cut the bs already!
0	Fuck that. America does not want to be like china. This is going to boil a lot of people's blood if this kind of policy is enacted.
0	I had 2 Pfizer Vaccines and I can feel the heart beat difference when I am running or biking. I can’t running or biking like before.  My heart is like 10 years older than before after I took the vaccine shots.
0	One year are people dying because they are pushed to vaccination.
1	Guys I have awesome news, just back from taking my Mum to the doctor's. She's had her first dose of the covid vacciâ€
1	I am so grateful I got the vaccine 2 months ago
0	For the record, I have not taken, nor do I intend to take any Covid Vaccine
0	I stand with the canadian truckers and everyone who decide not to get the jab
0	Key phrase, "According to Forbes".  Why doesn't anyone report on the content of the vaccine and long term affects?
0	RNA vaccines rarely work
1	Greetings from Mexico, my parents just got the Pfizer vaccine. They feel great! thanks to the scientist for this great achievement.
1	I am not a fool and so I had my vaccination at the very first opportunity and had no problems or side effects.  I can now face going out without any fear.
1	Anti vaxxers. A small minority of uneducated looneys who believe anyfink wot dey is reedin on da sosharl meedeearrr bruv, innit.
0	What ever happen to " to each their own"? Or "my body my choice"?
1	I'm sorry for your loss but just because it happened after getting vaccinated doesn't mean it's the vaccine
1	If I had young kids I’d get them vaccinated. It’s not even a question
1	Strength and love to the front line docs, nurses, techs and anyone involved with treating COVID patients. And for all patients, no matter what your political persuasion may be I want you well. You are my brothers and sisters. If you didn't get the vaccine and then contracted COVID and WISHED you had taken the vaxxine, please tell friends and family to get vaccinated!
0	Well done for mentioning alternatives other than vaccines, not.
1	Parents making a choice for their children to not vaccinate them, before their children can make that decision are doing wrong by them.
0	These vaccines should NEVER be mandatory. I am afraid of this vaccine.
1	More trustworthy than omicron.
1	so glad we can try to protect him with being vaccinated thus viral load is less in vaxed then unvaxed.
0	Yeah. Sell some vaccines. Apply psychological blackmail and stories about people that have accepted your false narrative. Sell sell sell. Pretend to fix a health crisis. While helping to create a health crisis.
0	No thanks. Only the older or people with underlying health issues NEED the vaxx. You can't argue with reality in the REALITY vs "science" debate. Look at the numbers. Healthy and young people don't need vaxx! Wake up!
1	I am the only doctor in a town of 700 people where almost everyone is anti-vaccine and now a new wave of covid is beginning
1	Im struggling to care and feel bad for these unvaccinated people who are now suffering from Covid. I do however, have a ton of sympathy for these healthcare workers working tirelessly to treat these patients. For the love of God, please get vaccinated “ I didn’t have time” is a ridiculous and ignorant excuse.  Stay safe everyone!! Greetings from
1	I'm ready to see all the anti vaxers come out in force now
0	I'm being pressured to get boosters every 3 months and I'm hesitant to take it so often
1	Get your entire family vaccinated to protect them, their school mates, friends, and family.
0	Wanna hear misinformation: 1) vaccines stop spread of omicron 2) masks work 3) the virus occured naturally 4) trump colluded with Russia Go after those idiots
1	Some people are mocking people that have three doses of the vaccines and still testing positive for COVID. But from this study the immunity generated by 'natural' infection is mostly penetrated by the Omicron variant. It's about the changes in the virus.
1	Don’t take the vaccine, I was Vaccinated and contracted Covid less then a week after, I was hospitalized for over a week. I’m still not 100%.
1	the vaccine is safe and effective at preventing serious illness and hospitalization
1	The tinfoil hat brigade should be made to watch this. (only kidding, you'll not change their dangerous opinions). Still, I'm very impressed by how this explanation is both easy-to-understand, and without hyperbole. Thank you.
1	I'm getting vaccinated I want to protect myself and my future quality of life.
1	lol whatever. If they were serious long term side effects that were common, we would absolutely know by now considering the amount of people who have the vaccine. Plus, to me, keeping my loved ones safe who I know are high risk outweighs the risks of side effects that might not ever show up.
0	Well that should pretty much be a wrap on omicron then. If the vaccine can t prevent infection and the variant is barely killing anyone, there s essentially no point in getting a 4th.
0	Evades some of our immunity? Have you taken a good look at the numbers? Is vaccine actually doing anything? Yes the virus is less aggressive, biology hasn't changed, that doesn't mean vaccines are in any way efficient...
1	I got vaccinated in May. I feel safe and my mom was in the ICU on life support, the Pfizer vaccine saved her life.
1	When comedians or anyone think they know more than the scientists that is why so many deaths unnecessary deaths in America for sure!
1	If your vaccinated you can get covid but if your not vaccinated you can still get void but the good thing is is your all vaccinated
1	New tagline for bigpharma “A vaccine A day keeps the pandemic away”
1	I just got my 2nd dose today I'm fully vaccinated now.
1	vaccines were never made to prevent viruses. They keep you alive and out of the hospital. Sorry for your sisters passing. The statistics show she had a higher chance of dying from lightning than from a vaccine. It likely wasn’t the vaccine itself.
1	As long as it protects you from the virus, ie you don't die or get hospitalized, the vaccine has done it's job
1	My uncle has had open heart surgeries twice and he has taken two doses of vaccine. Touchwood, he is fine. Many of our neighbors who are well over 60 have completed both their vaccines. So please don't panic and go for it. Sadly, the pandemic is here to stay for a long time :(
1	I’m kinda lost about this. Is this a good thing? Sorry if this sounds stupid but can someone explain it to me? Thank you
0	I came here to tell everyone that i wont be getting it. Also to the people that already got it and are planning to get their boosters , you will die a slow and painful early death.
1	I’m a science guy. My degree’s in biology and chemistry. I understand the COVID biology and the science behind the vaccines. I got mine, both. Tell your friends to get theirs, too.
0	Risk Vs Reward. Considering there is almost no risk to children, what are they to gain from this? We have no long term studies to know the risk yet. California is looking to make this shot mandatory for K-12. Why? It defines who follows their rules and who doesn't. I really hope the people fight this.
0	a vaccine cannot protect you completely from a virus, it can only lessen your symptoms if you happen to contract the virus, that is why there is no 100% efficacy. say, people who gets flu vaccine shots still gets sick once in a while but with lesser flu symptoms. and yes, the vaccine contains the weaker version of the virus cells itself.
1	My grand mother, 94y old, perfectly healthy, active - goes to the shop and and downtown every day, not obese, no comorbidities, taking no medicines, 2 times vaccinated without any side effects,
0	They're not vaccines they're gene therapies.
1	Anti vaccinations people must be as thick as two short planks.
1	I received my first if two COVID-19 vaccines today.  I was incredibly impressed with the efficient operation.  Great job Howard County Health Dept!
1	Wtf are these people thinking!! I am vaxed and still think this is way to young!! 99.999 kids are safe
0	Leave the people alone
1	If there is no reaction to the first dose, there is little risk of serious side effects from the second.
0	Can you please explain why so many people are getting covid 19 after vaccination ? Can you explain why teens are getting heart complications ? Can you explain why so many adverse effects from the vaccine ?
1	The vaccine causes some kind of immune super-response that makes severe disease more likely even as it protects most people (i.e. your chance of severe disease increases when vaccinated).
0	No vax but tested positive. Only reason I knew was because my taste was off for a couple days. No other symptoms. Now I have natural immunity without the risk of taking the vaccine.
1	All those who do not want to be vaccinated are ignorant and selfish people who do not care the least about their health and much less about the health of others.
1	If you were to count all vaccine side effects as deaths, and include all instances of terrible bullshit (like giving people diseases such as in Tuskegee), then receiving vaccines is still safer than abstaining from them. In a simple numbers game, even without factoring in group immunity, vaccines are the smart choice.
0	When will covid end? When we all either stop complying or you accept digital ID and social credit. There, I saved you 10 minutes.
1	Wrong. The vaccines DO lessen transmission. "These people" are selfish and stupid. They aren't making a choice based on facts or science. Their ignorance has caused our hospitals to be strained to the point where surgeries are being rescheduled, and people who need emergency care for other illnesses can't get it. The only diseases that have been eradicated are smallpox and rinderpest. But polio is very close to being eradicated--by vaccines. We rarely see children get measles in this country--because of vaccines. Your "personal freedom" to swing your arms ends at your neighbor's nose. You don't have a right to put others at risk.
0	20 boosters is the goal. That will produce the largest earnings for moderna and pfizer
0	There's no enough data to prove that 4th booster is actually needed.
0	the side effects I seen are enough not to take it.. as for the unknown side effects that are probly just as grave walking around in the vaccinated if contagious 🤔they would never amit it like for example omicron ? could that be from the vaccine shot ?  🤔
1	Another young sol dies from covid. So sad .Rest in peace. His family and friends will miss him. He is in heaven He was to young to pass Hopefully people will get the vaccine  that is not vaccinated. Please let's save lives.
1	Vaccines are a matter of public health. We are in a pandemic. Cut that "personal choice" "my body my choice" bs.
0	The interventions including mass vaccination fuels mutations. The 99% efficacy of the vax is creative math.
1	we know that on a population level, vaccines decrease vulnerability to severe disease
0	Vaccine does not work so why get it?
0	refusing an experimental drug doesnt make you an antivaxxer
0	These vaccine will damage your natural immunity in the long run just use your common sense
0	Vaccines stop the spread. - WRONG!
1	I don’t understand the “vaccine is oppressive” thing. It’s literally just instructions for your body to learn how to fend off a deadly virus. Your body memorizes the instructions and flushes it out of you in a matter of days. These people are insane.
0	Well good for them. I’m not taking it. I’ve never been jabbed with any of the vaccines and I don’t intend on starting now
1	My five year old granddaughter got her second dose January 7, with no side effects. Now I will have to be honest and say she did have covid this week, but all she had was 2 times of throwing up for three hours. That was it! I credit the vaccine for such mild symptoms.
1	I promise not everyone in Texas has such a blatant disregard for public safety. Most of us get our kids vaccinated.
1	bro i just got my 2nd one and now i can clip through reality
1	I am fully vaccinated and boosted, and if they ever tell me I need another shot, I'll take it because, you know, I like to live, I love my friends, and I love my neighbors.
1	It helps break the chain of COVID-19 transmission.
0	A virus so weak they had to release a vaccine to weaken your immune system just to kill you.
0	Always great to see the vast majority of comments are from the ones that never went near the vaccines, or won't take anymore of them. Gives me hope in humanity, and has always confirmed to me that the unvaxxed number are skewed for the agenda. I think they are saying 40 million unvaxxed in the US now. Amazing it was apparently 100 million only 2 months ago and they are pretending 60 million ran out and got injected since then.
1	just got my first shot. trust in the science.
0	Best immunity is by turning off your TV
0	There's no cure for that vaccine. Once you get it may God bless you
1	Unvaccinated people should be at the end of the line for treatment. Save the good stuff for people who are really unable to be vaxed with cancer who's bodies won't produce enough antibodies, or kids.
1	I believe it should be required by law to vaccinate our kids. Not only does it protect your child, it also protects people who cannot get them.
0	If you’re already vaccinated why would you be worried if someone else isn’t? All the risk is on them not you
1	come and bring your vaccines to florida.. NOW
0	Save yourself and your generation. Don't take it and don't let anyone you love take it either.
1	@StevenTongate @outtastateplate @Gort2024 @PressSec @billmaher You got COVID from some idiot who got a fake Covid vaccine form, or from a “carrier” who did not know they are a carrier. I’m vaccinated, but still wear a mask because a lot of unvaccinated people go maskless. We are surrounded by idiots feeling entitled to freedoms un-deserved.
0	I work in a hospital and most of the patients who are in the covid unit are vaccinated!!
0	Other than what you've heard on TV, can you prove vaccines work? And if you're going to respond with regards to polio and diphtheria, can you prove that vaccines were effective against those viruses? I mean actual proof.
1	I cant give specific, individualized medical advice, but a history of thrombocytopenia is not considered a contraindication to the mRNA vaccines. However, any person with concerns about their personal medical situation as it relates to the vaccine should speak with their own physicians who know the full details of their medical history.
1	Yes, of course you have already had the virus, I believe you despite the thousands of times people lie on here to try and prove their point. Of course, the USA is the root of 99% of all conspiracy theories so maybe you should be thinking of whether to believe the yank idiots who come up with these conspiracies or believe educated scientists?
1	vaccines SAVES lives
0	Not a vaccine. It doesn’t work you retards.
0	The side effects are very big
0	no to vax!
1	Oh look, they found one guy to tell us vaccines are bad...
1	anti-vaxxers are so dumb. They'll eat processed shit they get off of walmart shelves all day but they won't get vaccinated. I guess this is what happens when people don't get polio for 50 years, they think it must not exist.
1	My step son is 47 & unvaccinated. He is on a vent now & he is so ill they've started him on ECMO. He has 21 days to improve or he will be moved to comfort care, which means he will die. His family is beyond heartbroken & he is in a coma & has no idea what will happen to him. He has no say. He has 3 kids, the youngest is 4. I wouldn't wish this on anyone. The hospital hasn't lost 1 person who was vaccinated. Let that sink in.
0	It’s the ones with the shots that are hospitalized. If they put the truth and full truth no one would get it.
1	About 96% of all physicians are fully vaccinated. So, at most, 4% oppose vaccines. Suppose you were contemplating surgery and 96% of the physicians you consulted told you you would die without it but 4% told you you’d be fine. How many of these people would listen to the 4%?
1	Anti-Vax & Flat Earth community are one in the same. Change my mind.
0	I think these vaccines are responsible for brain shrinkage
1	Someone was asking the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine. Well, I can categorically tell you that all WHO and CDC-approved COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective!
0	Why are you not reporting on the vaccine inefficiency. When did the right to question become wrong
1	I am so thankful that I am not a republican. I am so happy Trump is gone. i am vaccinated, boosted and alive
1	I have had my third shot, I love it
0	It's my body I have full right to say no vaccine
1	I'm happy to report that I received my second dose of the Moderna vaccine last Wednesday and I only had one day of feeling a bit crummy. All is well and I am now up-to-date on my vaccinations. ⁣
1	I’ve told my anti-vaxx family members we cannot see each other unless and until they are all fully vaccinated.
1	i had the vaccines i feel good.
0	If you think that experimental mystery injection is going anywhere near my toddlers, you’ve got another thing coming!
0	World is thankfully WAKING UP to your outright lies and emotional manipulation. Say no to vaccine.
1	85% of patients are non-vaccinated patients, hospitalizations that are perfectly avoidable
0	To me, natural antibodies are better than any man-made antibodies
1	We need boosters because they work. Understood
0	I cannot believe people think it's odd that one may not want to volunteer themselves for the current covid-19 vaccine human trials.
1	Follow the Science people, if you don't get vaccinated you can give the virus to vaccinated people!
0	no need vaccines or bosster shots, God already gives us super natural powetful immunity. why need vaxx, prayed to God
0	I got the vaccine in December I’m a health care worker so it was available to us first and I now have neuropathy and another nurse went death I hate I agreed to get it
1	why not take the vaccine and be done with it?
0	Don't mess with my DNA!!!!!!
0	3rd wave is causing of these vaccines... Don't take it
0	I am not taking it
0	This vaccine thing it’s really crazy.
1	Got my #BoosterDose today!
1	Got my first shot of Pfizer a week ago, can't wait to get the second shot
0	They can never make it mandatory it’s against your human rights. It’s just a case of holding your nerve. Bravo to those with the balls to say no
1	of course vaccines are not fake but people are stupid enough to not get a vaccine to save them so I say let them not get tetanus shot so they get lock jaw
0	I have covid right now. I don’t have vaccine and I don’t have any symptoms. Why would I be getting a vaccine?
1	The hospital I work for just went a full week with no new COVID cases among staff for the first time since Feb 2020. Very cool to see the vaccine in action.
0	Fuck the ‘vaccine’
0	In Austria vaccination is compulsory! With a fine at the end! All this for a vaccine that does not work. AMAZING
0	The way they are pushing this vaccine is enough to make me run in the opposite direction. This is nothing to do with health - there is something else behind this!
1	Looks like this is the most wonderful vaccine ever created, in fact it's the greatest of the greatest thing mankind has created in history. Wow!!
0	We should be able to make a pretty huge dent in the death rate by late January with some strong prioritization.
0	I'm unvaccinated I'll sit any room with anyone who has any disease my Father in Heaven is stronger than any disease on this planet bring it
0	Still unvaxxed. So there's that.
0	I will wait 1 year before I take it… atleast
0	I have been highly skeptical of the vaccine and Pfizer in particular. This interview hasn't changed my view at all.
1	So the vaccines are not stopping you from catching Covid. So you are still in the same boat are you not.
0	With them Omicron spreading like a wildfire, we can see how ineffective vaccines are with the prevention of the spread. Luckily, this variant is mild.
0	It's illegal. We're not animals. Don't force us to use self defense.
0	Vaccine's that don't work,test that are not accurate and mandates directed by people who know nothing. All being pushed by a media owned the left-wing nuts. THINK !
0	that vaccine doesn't work, it's just for your peace of mind
1	the vaccine is not debatable. it is proven to work and if you disagree you are simply wrong
1	Thankful to have completed my 2nd dose last week with only 1 side effect (sore arm).
0	Question, I can’t remember my source but when I watched the video and looked up the person she did seem credible. She was saying that the vaccine contains graphene oxide as well as the booster. This is a poison. And it isn’t listed in the ingredients but hidden under proprietary ingredients. What are your thoughts on that and why they would need to put graphene oxide in us and continue to do so with the boosters?
0	vaccine its not true ,, i have 2nd dose vaccine why i have omicron ?
1	I will say I’m vaccinated and boosted. Tested positive recently and I’m still here. Vaccines work!
1	Vaccines are safe, and save lives
1	So much unnecessary death and suffering. Vaccines work. Reality doesn't reach some. We still need to get vaccinated asap and follow medical guidance to slow down this infection. This is a song of hope. Break Down These Walls.
1	got my first dose of Vaccine , this can be a help to my country
0	They didn’t get a vaccine for a virus , they got a sterilization shot
1	Wow! I’m fully a pro-vaxer yet still found I had believed one of the myths! It never sat well with me that I “knew” for a “fact” that vaccinated people can “still spread the virus” I’m so grateful for finally seeing perspective on this issue!
1	Let's get vaccinated! We can all help do our part for the greater community by vaccinating. Sleeve up!!
0	Seriously though, why can’t a person make their own choice about getting jabbed without ridicule?
0	Of course nope!!The vaccine has many side effect.
0	From my analysis getting the vaccine for my case (young, healthy man) has a higher risk than being sick for covid. It's a serious question, I'd like to see how to approach it from a different perspective.
0	Don’t but that poison into your body
1	I support you and your video I'm a firm believer in vaccinating our children safe. keep up the good work
1	great info. but could you please explain why individuals with natural immunity still need to be vaccinated?
1	thank you so much for easing certain doubts.... a few of us nursing students will be getting the vaccine soon and i think we'll take our chances!
1	post-vaccination COVID-19 is associated with a 79% reduced risk of death (aHR 0.21, 0.11- 0.42) in cirrhosis- Our paper in
0	I still ain’t getting this vaccine all of you can smd!
0	Two guinea pigs in a pub having a beer, One asks “Are you getting the jab?” the other said “Na I’m waiting for the human trials to end!”
0	No thank you. I'll just eat healthy.
0	And almost all cases are fully vaccinated.
1	I'm so tired of the anti-vaxxers out in full force, protesting in the streets!
1	There should've been mandatory vaccination from day 1, and we wouldn't be facing any form of containment measures at all anymore
0	FDA/Pfizer refuse to disclose clinical trial data, yet we are being forced to take the vaccine.  Hence, lawsuits to force disclosure.  Again, if safe then why the lack of transparency?
0	See people are having extreme side effects
1	It is remarkable how people say "don't get vaccinated because someone is pressuring you" while at the same time pressuring their environment not to get the vaccine.
0	Aside from COVID-19, mRNA could really be the future. It's possibilities are huge.
0	Would have loved to work in the compounding department in one of these drug companies. I guess they made all employees sign secret agreements!
0	Moderna has no experience ever developing a vaccine.... covid 19 is the first and its all rushed.
0	Most of us are not anti vax. We are anti new and no long term side effects studies done. Big difference.
1	Got my pfizer vaccine today. Feeling good, just a little bit tired. Looking forward to putting COVID behind us
1	No, mRNA vaccine technologies are not new. The medical applications of potential mRNA technologies were realized soon after the discovery of mRNA
1	This was my reasoning when I got the AstraZeneca jab, even though I'm in my early 30s. Yes, there seem to be some risks. And of course there are unknown long-term risks. But the risks of the virus seem greater than the risk of the vaccine.
0	Practically every woman I know who is vaccinated for COVID-19 who usually has very regular periods has been affected by the vaccine in this particular way.
1	I felt perfectly fine afterwards, all three times
1	As a healthcare worker I am always amazed how the majority of the population can't do college level science but are suddenly virology majors. I wish they had medical training and could comprehend the stupidity of their "expertise".
1	This doctor gives me hope.  I had the first Moderna shot, and am so scared to get the second, because of what I hear.   After watching people with Covid-19 online......the shot is worth it.
0	2 years of kids not getting sick, 'but we need to make sure the data meets the expectations', and they need 3 shots. Funny!
1	Good news for us, a study has revealed that the #Sinopharm vaccine is effective against the SA variant!
0	Another mutation,another varriant,same vaccine
0	i'm not getting something.. if the studies show the vaccines are effective, why is "the world" worried?
0	Professor Bernard Lascola of the IHU Marseille: "I am shocked. In serology, the antibodies of people infected with Omicron do not recognise the Wuhan strain that was used to create the vaccine. Booster shot totally useless…
1	I scheduled my vaccine after watching this video...Thank you for explaining everything so well.
0	No jabs! Put Fauci in jail!
1	I will take it ...get it approved Joe ByeDon
1	Another pointless study showing what teenagers can work out, the vaccine helps with hospitalisations but vaccines are not made to reduce hospitalisations they are made to reduce infections which inevitably reduces hospitalisations and deaths it’s really common sense
1	I encourage anyone who is not vaccinated to #GetVaccinatedNow
0	Just because FDA approval, doesn't mean it's safe.
0	Trudeau hid the fact that he receives a commission every time Pfizer or Moderna vaccines are administered!  Acuitas Therapeutics produces the lipid nanoparticle technology used in the Pfizer vaccine! The Trudeau Foundation owns 40% of Acuitas!  And Macron?
1	The vaccine is working so we’re pretty much back to normal - have you not gone outside recently?
1	Anti-Vaxx and stupid people in general LOVE to misinterpret "the vaccine doesn't prevent 100% of all infections" as "the vaccine doesn't prevent infections"
1	The lab rats are doing fine. The human subjects are doing fine. The tests are over and the results are in. It's safe it works and we squandered a good vaccine and a lot of money cause morons couldn't do the bare minimum.
1	If you don't get the vaccine then you are putting yourself and other people at risk.
0	I will not being getting the vaccine at my doctors advice due to an upcoming surgery, but I really have zero sympathy for obese people that have zero care for their bodies and were bound to die from anything at a higher rate.
0	Don’t give vax to your children
0	Thousands flee Germany leaving thousands of hospital beds for the vaccinated. I hope the vaccinated are happy
1	I'm vaccinated. period.
1	I just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far. Thank you to all the scientists and researchers around the world for making the vaccine available this early and thank you for this channel for spreading the science. Yes, it’s definitely OK to be smart. Science rules!!!!
0	My right to freedom is that you should not get close to me if you're unvaccinated
0	The ironic thing is for redditor s to be so anti-rich, the vaccine is literally the gold vein for the massive corporations behind these. They are getting richer than you can ever imagine.
0	Keep repeating the word safe and effective, safe and  effective, safe effective. That’s all you really need to know about this vaccine.
1	COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for people who are pregnant, trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future, as well as their partners
0	I’m still not getting vaccinated.
0	My husband is 2x vaxed and I am not. We contracted Covid mid January. He had it longer and his symptoms were worse. Thankfully, we are well now. That vaccine is worthless.
1	We got our shots...and it works
0	Nurses who took care of us during the hardest parts of this outbreak are being forced out of their jobs because of not getting a vaccination. Absolutely awful treatment to our "heroes" we used to thank so much.
0	I took the vaccine yesterday and I got the worst migraine of my life today. The night followig the vaccination I felt chills the whole night and was freezing even with two thick hoodies on. I regret taking it so fkn much as I was completely fine before and I never got sick with covid these last 2 years
0	No thank you! The joints in my arms are still aching from that last series of Covid shots. Wished I never took them.
0	if you’re so afraid of dying from Covid, then you stay home bud. I’ll go out unvaccinated if I want
0	My mother-in-law has been fully vaccinated and still got Covid (even went to the ER twice) while me and my wife, my father-in-law, brother-in-law and sister-in-law all had covid last year, and never showed any symptoms when my mother-in-law got it. Her husband kept getting negative test results. I'm not anti vaccine, I'm just not not a fan of getting a shot that doesnt work
1	Probably, but don't assume this is statistically significant.
1	I have ZERO sympathy for the anti-masker / anti-vaxxer that die from COVID
1	Great news. The world needs more vaccines.
0	First it was no boosters, then a booster every 6 months, now 3 months. Next, it'll be every month, wait. Big pharma will not be denied.
1	3 (Three, as in 1,2 3) to 700.000+ - Ratio of vaxx deaths to covid deaths in the US.
1	Why didn’t they get adults who weren’t vaccinated.... oh wait
0	Lovely 30 second video from our beloved government. Hopefully you trust them enough to ensure your kids don't end up with birth defects
0	SHE DIED FROM THE VACCINE. TELL THE TRUTH .
0	why not just strengthen your immune system so your body can do its job and not need a vaccine? A healthy body doesn't need a vaccine. Take care of yourself and you'll be okay.
1	I've had virus multiple times... all month long (January) 4 people tested positive, no terrible symptoms at all. 2 unvaccinated however we all had Covid before the vaccine
1	I am fully vaccinated and the peace of mind I feel is the opposite of the helplessness I felt for so long. Living with a fully vaccinated person as well. I'm very grateful.
1	Get your first vaccine if you haven’t already. Vaccines save lives...period.
1	You take the shot not for yourself but for other people too!
1	Get vaccinated, idiot. It's not that hard to understand. Get vaccinated or stay the F' home.
0	97% of people have they have the virus and they do not even realize they have it...only 3% was hospitalized...the virus is not dangerous...the virus become dangerous when your immune system is not working properly.
0	No because there is no such thing as Covid-19
1	I waited so long for this!!
0	Why did they require people to sign a waiver if the vaccines are safe?
1	4316 people died yesterday from a virus that has a free vaccine. Get vaccinated. Jesus fucking christ.
0	Here is a reason to be cheerful: Covid is done and we dont need anymore vaccines.
0	The Vaccine is used as an emergency treatment so no guidelines just shoot and pray it’s not fda approved so a lot more people are going to die from the non protective false hope vaccine
1	Healthcare professionals and care home staff were among the first cohorts to get the vaccine and have barely suffered serious secondary effects.
1	the point of a vaccine is to train your immune system before you get infected. That way it acts quicker and it's more effective when you do get COVID. That helps prevent sickness or at least severe forms of the illness.
0	Simple question. Would you as a doctor trust the vaccine enough to put your livelihood on the line. If let say 5 years from now we find out there is a huge side effect from the vaccine, would you be will to take the responsibility of providing those effected from vaccine side homes and incomes for the rest of their lives? Because right now the pharmaceutical companies have no liability. Maybe we put that liability on Medical professionals themselves and see how much faith they have in these vaccines
0	maybe not wanting to get the vaccine stems way back from when I was in high school, a big epidemic was the Asiatic flu. We had to get flu shots, and we all got sick.
0	For normal everyday use, those who get the double shots, are being hospitalized at a ratio of 9 to 1 over unvaccinated.
1	Thank you to the 85.2% vaccinated Canadians and ALL front-line workers keeping us going! These are the real patriots!
0	So sad, vaccine kill our youth
0	That's interesting, why didn't you bring up that vaccines have to have a way longer testing trail periods and a far grander pool of participants to determine if they are save, than we had even until now? Or that governments gave exemptions to pharmaceutical companies to shield them from liability?
0	If the germ theory were true, we would all be dead! Discredited 160 years ago. Virology is a scam.
0	This was all a “Conspiracy Theory” about a year ago
0	You arent considered fully vaccinated until 2 WEEKS AFTER THE 2ND DOSE meaning if you die from the vaccine, your death will go down as unvaccinated and from Covid. Just another way the Jews inflate the numbers and make it seem only unvaccinated people are dying
0	I’m good with my natural immunity thanks.
1	Can i just say these vaccines are safe and effective. I have taken none of them. But these vaccines are safe and effective.
0	Same here I got vaccinated than I got vertigo before that I was well fine
0	We have looked at our quarterly earnings and have determined that children as young as 6 months now need to be vaccinated.
1	3rd COVID vaccine dose
1	I took the vaccine and I'm grateful
0	I'm anti anything thats being FORCED on the public!
1	Every shot, pill, surgery even over the counter medication comes with a slight risk. MRNA vaccines are amongst the safest, most well documented medical advancements in history. Over 10 billion doses administered, millions of lives saved. Let’s call our doctors for medical advice
0	What surprises me most is that when patients get serious side effects after the first dose and that doctors will then still recommend the second dose...
0	God punish vaccine
1	That's the normal side effects of the vaccine. Believe me, some days of feeling sick id way better than having to en entubed in a ventilator, and possibly die.
1	thank you for the explanations. I hope it will convince some people to get vaccinated.
0	A good friend of mine passed away from a massive heart attack the day after her second Covid shot. She was otherwise very healthy.
1	Vaccines are an incredible thing and I'm grateful that we have them
0	IF THE NURSES ARE QUITTING ITS A RED FLAG! DO NOT BELIVE IN THE VACCINE!
1	How are they going to convince people to get vaccinated? I'm not seeing any campaigns or anything.
1	Time to pull up your arm and take it
0	literally everyone i know who is sick with covid right now has had 2 or more jabs. i literally know nobody who is sick who is unvaccinated.
1	I contracted Covid in December, before vaccines were available.  I was first in line when I was eligible, for my first shot and then my second.  Believe me, not being able to breathe was my motive!  I still have some after effects 8 months later but nothing compared to what I went through!!
0	I don't want to know what's going too happen after all the vaccines they are trying to put in our body's...no vaccine here yet for me until I know alot more about it..
0	Leave us alone. We want peace.
0	Why would I need to get boosted if it obviously doesn't work??
0	The "vaccine" is not permanent. Not only that, the "vaccine" doesn't even work (because it's not a vaccine). It doesn't give you immunity from the virus, and it doesn't stop you from being contagious.
0	I had my second AstraZeneca vaccination over three weeks ago and I haven’t been right since. I just feel weak and want to sleep all the time. I won’t be having a booster.
0	It's all about money
1	I’m 18 and healthy, haven’t gotten the vaccine yet but I definitely will.
0	Please don’t google the largest criminal settlement in history! It definitely wouldn’t be a pharma co that’s trying to sell you a vax!
0	the vaccine passport isn't technological advancement it's misuse of technology
1	Please begin distributing the pledged vaccines today to Uganda for tomorrow will be too late to save many lives as oxygen and ICU beds remain in short supply amidst escalating cases.
1	To Pfizer, this is far greater achievement than Viagra 2 decades ago. If it keeps being successful, those scientists deserve Nobel Prize!
1	If no vaccines are effective why is it that my great aunt died of diphtheria in the year of 1911, but in recent years individual deaths are named. The difference a vaccination and an antitoxin.
1	We now have sufficient experience to confirm the importance of vaccination against COVID-19 during pregnancy. Indeed, vaccination can be done without risk at any stage of pregnancy
0	Vaccine is not safe. I am not stupid you government can't tell people what to do about our body
0	These doctors are the opposite of selfish.  They are demonstrating courage, integrity and discernment that has been notably absent from regulators and media.  I applaud them and support them 100%.  The decision to end the mandate is a victory for the public and for the nation.
1	If you can’t trust the vaccine, at least don’t trust the virus. Wear a mask.
0	All vaccines don’t stop the spread of disease. All are dangerous. All made by the same companies
1	My parents didn’t take it but I will! Lets get this over with.
1	If you have something to say against vaccines, get a 9 year medical education and specialise in respiratory diseases, then maybe you can bring something to the table
1	Get vaccinated and let's move on. Go JNJ vaccine!
0	The jab side effects kills 2 people for every one it saves from CV.
0	But if you are going to use a fake weapon in a real battle, you can not win...
1	her dad made the choice for a logical reason and not because he is stupid enough to believe the false claims of the anti-vaxxers and call the vaccines ‘experimental’. You have to be a complete moron to believe that crap. Look it up.
0	To all those that vaccinated AND caught covid........ I'm unvaccinated and never had it.....
0	Sadly, the long term damage from these jabs will be immense.
0	If the vaccine was as effective as they claim they wouldn’t want to wait 55 years before they tell how good it is.
0	Look at third world countries that are doing much better with omicron despite their very low vaccination rate; natural immunity is more effective than vaccination.
1	I'm double vaxed & boostered - tested positive NYE Day after having a scratchy throat/runny nose for a few days. So glad it never got worse and I didn't spread it to my teen daughter or hubby (I have no doubt it's because of the vaccines/boosters we all got).
1	The corona wirus is notable for it's attribute of constantly mutating. That is why a vaccine against a corona virus will never be effective. By the time you get the vaccine, the new variant is already spreading . . . like the delta variant.
0	Imagine being forced to take a medicine that doesn't even do what is supposed to...
1	And here is to hoping that they have enough common sense to get the vaccine regardless
1	The point these doctors are making can't be stressed enough! We will not defeat (or be able to live with it) covid until the world is vaccinated. We need to help other nations.
0	I got covid while unvaxxed, still unvaxxed and will remain that way!
1	The COVID-19 vaccines should be mandated for all schools.
1	To the vaccinated: get your booster shot because the first two didn't work. To the unvaccinated: get your first two shots so you will be safe. HOW DO PEOPLE NOT SEE THIS. Twilight Zone
0	Its been over 30 years since I have been sick...,last time was rigth after I took a recommended vaccine...never again, I like staying healthy!
0	When they try to force you to take something “for your own good”, threaten to have you fired from your job, offer payments for people without jobs to get this poison,  it is 100% NOT for your own good.
0	Why would pfizer do this if not for money, it is fishy
1	Hope Chinese citizens like me can have vaccine very soon..
1	This new vaccine technology is impressive!
1	Vaccines have been saving lives for decades!
1	Got the full Moderna and booster. Currently positive for Covid nine days after testing positive initially cause that five day quarantine is horseshit, and just have a slight itch in my throat and very mild cough. Glad I got Moderna.
1	I work in healthcare and I've been fully vaccinated. I believe in the vaccine and have seen its benefits in my hospital. I CHOSE to have it because of many factors, and that choice was very important.
1	I can’t imagine looking at the global situation for the past two years and deciding the best take is to stay unvaccinated. I wish more people could see pictures and videos of what COVID patients in the hospital look like. I want them to see intubation and sedation. The rotating beds like you’re cooking human rotisserie chicken. Mention that they are not just tubed in their throat but up their ass and whatever pee function they have. I often wonder if these people had half a clue as to the indignities they could suffer, would they change their minds. Probably not… but man, am I glad for the two hours I’ve taken since the spring to get three shots to prevent having tubes up my holes and maggots growing in my face. And, you know, living life mindfully but not in fear, like so many assume.
0	the vaccine is just so new that I don’t want to take it.
1	The amount of research that has gone into confirming the safety of the new formulation of the COVID vaccine is enormous, as has the amount of caution shown by the FDA and CDC
0	You know there’s something wrong when they try to “force” something on you
0	Hello! I am not super eduated on this topic as I've not taken a biology course in years, however, I am concered about any long-term effects the vaccine can have especially because unlike other vaccines, this vaccine has not had years of research to determine any possible long term effects
1	I’m proud to be vaccinated. I did it to protect myself. I did it protect my family and friends. It was part of what I could personally do to help us get through this public health crisis.
1	The arrival of safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines is a major development in the coronavirus pandemic. An effective COVID-19 vaccine will help protect people who come in contact with the virus from becoming sick. As more people are vaccinated, families and communities will be able to gradually return to a more normal routine.
0	A false vaccine claim made by people that they became magnetic after vaccination say, keys and utensils are attracted towards their body. Because the keys are usually made up of brass they are not magnetic
1	Doing just fine after a year with the vaccine
1	So refreshing to have a pro vaccine message that doesn’t treat the listener like an idiot. Thank you!
1	If vaccines cause Alzheimer’s, and so many people take vaccines (including me) why don’t we have it yet?
1	The benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks, fact!
0	The long term is 2 to 3 years. I'll take my vaccine after 3 years
0	Good to know at least someone else doesn't worship Big Pharma.
0	Falling on the ground with the vaccine is accurate where did the virus originated to the Jab itself
0	It is time to stop scaring people about the vaccine AND quit demanding everyone get the vaccine.
1	The difference is being vaccinated and masking during peaks is doing the best you can to keep yourself, your family, and your community safe. It isn't 100%, but 60-94% protected is better than 0% protected and walking boldly straight into the grave like this bad dad did. The risks are extremely higher being infected with the real virus than showing your immune system warning shots with vaccinations. The risks you're worried about are not real. You are listening to lies mostly from people with no medical education at all. I am telling you this based on the medical knowledge I have from my lifetime career in health care, not politically motivated propaganda being spread around since 2019. But, if you believed medical professionals, you'd already know all this, so I'm surely wasting my time tapping it out for you right now.
1	Vaccinating your child is sick. who would do that, its unsafe, and unhealthy I let my doctor vaccinate them instead, I don't know about that stuff.
0	And that’s exactly why I would NEVER wear a mask or vaccinate! I win
0	More people that get the jab are the ones spreading the virus and the ones that are getting sick. Everyone I know that got the jab have gotten the sickness.
1	It just amazed me how ridiculous people can be. The reason the vaccine was made so quickly is because they got all the experts from around the world to help with it. They don't do that with other vaccines. The nurse I'm shocked by. Her job is not just a job but a vocation. She's supposed to help people get better. America seems to be one huge asylum.
0	Those injections are crap, home remedies are far better and won't kill you
0	because the VAX doesn't work
1	get the vaccine
0	Getting closer and closer to making it mandatory. I see the moves being made! Biggest drug deal in history. Take note!!!
0	Just a simple question for everyone, since when did the government start caring for your health?
0	Cant prove it but my father got the "vaccine" in March died in June
1	When I caught Covid, it was terrible but I never had to consider the ER. I have an autoimmune disease and COPD. I’m so glad I got vaxxed. My daughter didn’t catch it. Yes!
1	My pregnant sister basically had to tell my parents they weren't allowed to see their first grandchild until they got vaccinated. They grumbled about it for a bit, but they did it!
1	Together we can ended it
1	I am triple vaxxed, so is my husband, oldest teenager, my youngest can't be but has 2. I am immunosuppressed becaus ei have 2 auto immune diseases and take biologic meds. I got covid travelling at Christmas. So mild. Like a mild cold, I felt tired mostly. My 3 family memebers tested each several times...all negative. Vaccines work!
1	Thousands more unvaxxed, obese Americans (mainly Trump voters) will die before the disease becomes endemic. That's why Trump himself upset his base by asking them all to get vaxxed. His voters are dying off.
1	Your body will only be able to adapt, adjust & heal if you first understand what it takes to keep it healthy.
1	I just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far. Thank you to all the scientists and researchers around the world for making the vaccine available this early. Yes, it’s definitely OK to be smart. Science rules!
1	got fully vaccinated. Then after a month i got covid hehe... Still thankful for being vaccinated. I have a lot of medical problems that is respiratory related in my previous years such an bronchitis and pneumonia. If i haven't gotten any vaccine. I may have severe symptoms. Luckily i was just classified as asymptomatic when i got covid.
1	I have them all!
0	it's been proven not to work and be harmful to healthy people but let's force them to take the vaccine
0	Never vaxed, never masked.  I've enjoyed watching all the lemmings.
0	Sorry but I'm one of those selfish people that won't take that vaccine. Personal choice. Never been sick.
0	Home of the free, as long as you do what they say.
1	For non vaccinated.. They may have the right not to be vaccinated but I have the right to not be around them.
1	I love that they are all about medical freedom and choice, but when we choose to get our kids vaccinated they jump down our throats. But nothing can bring me down! My high risk 6 year old is booked for this weekend to get her first dose! 🎉it will be a celebration!
0	How about just not taking the vaccine?
1	I took the Pfizer vaccine. Both doses. Extremely mild side effects, barely noticed them. No problems, and I've been well protected
0	If it becomes "mandatory", I'll just pay the nurse to shoot it in the sink and record that I had it. I'm never accepting this fraud.
0	If you've had yourself or your children "vaccinated", you've done something very scary and irreversible to yourself and your children. How does that make you feel? What will your children think of you when they realize what you've done to them? Does it make you feel like it would be unfair if other people didn't ignorantly, needlessly and willingly do to themselves and their children by choice what you've ignorantly, needlessly and willingly done to yourself and your children by choice?
0	Will continue to wear a mask and do social distancing but I will not take vaccine.
0	NO They are omitting processes that are crucial for conducting safe vaccine studies. Because of the media's excitement, they're attempting to rush this.
0	The vaccine is possibly binding the virus... not good.
0	What losers would give the covid vaccine to their children.
0	It's safe not to get it
0	Because it's toxic!
0	"If the vaccines are safe" is questionable after the Florida doctor died from it.
1	It’s amazing, and should be something we are all excited about. A HUGE advancement in the medical field and will change the future of vaccines. It’s a shame partisanship and drama is putting a damper on that.
0	not worth it, in addition to not IMMUNIZING THE ORGANISM, it has these risks.
1	I have been on the fence...worried about long term effects. I scheduled my vaccine after watching this video...Thank you for explaining everything so well.
0	I had a bad reaction to the vaccine that I m only just now getting over. I had to get antibiotics. Every other week it seems like a type of the vaccine is coming out with new deadly reactions. This vaccine happened too fast and we do not have enough data to say that it is safe to make it a requirement for things just yet.
0	the vaccines were the carrot on the end of the stick to give people something to wait for, I'm afraid it was a false hope, it was a cynical move on their part, the sickest thing is it caused them to block all other forms of early treatment.
0	They keep you from getting Covid then why the mask and distance after. Ill help you. You really have no fking idea if it does or not. Rolling the dice. With our lives.
0	I’m not getting that shit either I’m good lol
1	You wont have the advantage of maximal immunity, if you don’t take the second shot. So its not dangerous, but if you felt more-or-less fine after the first shot, there's not a good reason to skip the second
1	im so thankful my vaccine worked! feels like i’ve only been eating n sleeping for 3 days because of covid—not the worst symptoms imo. go science!!!!
0	Only took the idea of endless boosters for people to finally start wising up
0	The only 'need' for an vaccine is to continue to propigate fear & profit by big pharma.
0	I don’t care how safe it is. Me and my family will not be taking it regardless.
1	Note what he said at the beginning and the end: we were able to get to finished vaccine because of all the research into other coronavira over more than a decade. They did not start from scratch! Get the vaccine!
0	My neighbor died from the second moderna dose! I still have yet to see someone suffer/die from covid itself.
0	I had Delta in 2020. Double vaccination of moderna from then . Than got omicron in 2021. I stuck with skin problems for all the two years. Still have skin problems. I believe is my immune system over acted
1	Its amazing how the politicians are vaccinated and keep telling the people they don't have to be vaccinated.
0	Out of the lab and into your body. Yeah um no thanks. mRNA vaccines still seem incredibly creepy on a cellular level, and I will not be taking one, two, or three of them. I would rather my body fight covid naturally on it's own.
0	Demonstrating once again that the so-called "vaccine" DOES NOT STOP YOU GETTING COVID.
0	Those who were fired due to Joe Biden’s illegal vaccine mandate should be offered their jobs back and receive back pay courtesy of the federal government.
0	No more experimental drugs
1	Had both Pfizer shots. Barely noticeable symptoms. Glad I got vaccinated !
1	Pls everyone take it
0	The vaccinated are going to be really mad in the next few years when they realize spike proteins have fried their organs
0	The pandemic isn’t going anywhere with the vaccine I caught Covid from vaccinated family members I felt fine just a sore throat and they where in bed for three days with all the symptoms so In my opinion NO THANKS
1	I had covid and it almost killed me. All kinds of crazy and unpleasant symptoms. I still to this day, cannot fully smell. Mofos keep saying, "oh don't worry you'll get your sense of smell back." Meanwhile, 8 months later I'm still waiting for it to come back. What the heck is up with that?
0	Smart man! I m not getting that shot either!
0	Fuck this fucking fuck. This stupid dickhead just cemented the decision to not get vaxxed in tens of millions of people. This dictatorship BS will not stand in this country.
0	Being vaxxed is one thing. Being immune is ANOTHER thing (completely different)!
1	Let's all start treating anti vaxxers like what they are. They are the modern day lepers. They need to be shunned, chased away, silenced. If you know anyone who is anti Vax, please just delete them from your life. In this day and age how anyone can be so dumb is beyond me.
1	If you're not vaccinated you are more likely to become seriously ill and take up hospital beds that then other people can't use.
0	You have been lied to for two years, purpose, to get that needle into your arm.
0	Glad see everyone finally waking up. I used to get called a conspiracy nut Job two years ago just for saying what most are saying now
1	Currently in my way to dose 2 of Pfizer’s vaccination. Good luck to all on the road to a world immune to covid.
1	Boost achieved #BoosterDose
1	I simply wz stating tht if a vaccinated person gets the virus they wont end up on a ventilator
1	May I have one of their vaccines please?
0	I don't want to take it because of the possible health risks that may come with it..
1	We have a couple anti-vax neighbors. Both healthy farm types with no comorbidities that I know of. The wife is dead, the husband is in hospital for a second time. Get vaccinated
0	The vaccine is safe!… source, “trust me bro!”
0	personally i rather die than live in a society that doesnt respect me and my beliefs
0	My mum looked like she had covid after the vaccine. Struggling to breath. Hasn't been out this whole year and has been fine. Takes the vaccine now looks close to death. Same with my dad. He's just got over cancer and was doing pretty well. Takes this rubbish and again now looks like he's close to death. Take it if you want to take it but I won't be.
0	"Pureblood" today means uninjected with the so-called "Covid vaccine". It does not refer to any racial or religious background. Our nation's survival depends on the remnant of this type of "purebloods", from all races and religions.
0	Look at third world countries that are doing much better with omicron despite their very low vaccination rate; natural immunity is more effective than vaccination.
1	Bullshit scaremongering
0	I’m on zero vaccine and doing very well
1	My husband died Friday of covid. He wasn't an actor and this covid pandemic is very real. Please get vaccinated
1	If you don't want to be vaccinated, then always mask-up when in public places and expect to not be allowed into some establishments due to a lack of vaccination proof. Your choice, Our Choice
0	What Utter Garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is full of poisons, unknown material with unknown effects.
0	There has been a major deception concerning the covid “pandemic”, and it seems that Christians have been as deceived as much as anyone. I agree by repeating your decree, “WAKE UP, Church! Stop Satan, Covid And the Vaccine Tyranny!”
1	Vaccinations are very Important and prevent global deaths and pandemics , far worse than Covid19.. There is absolutely no scientific evidence that they cause autism... I'm am thankful to have all my vaccinations and my daughter has had all hers too. Good for this lady who is doing the very best for her child
0	Given the fact the first two shots failed, why would someone sign up for 3rd dose?
1	The "older" technologies have allowed vaccines against covid with 100% rate at stopping any serious illness from the virus. That is all that is needed.
1	Finally got Covid. Fortunately I had done my own research, and concluded that I should be fully vaccinated and get a booster shot, so I've had very mild symptoms so far. Highly recommend doing your own research, which will lead you to the same conclusion!
0	We’ve reached critical mass: pejoratives like “anti-vaxxer” and “conspiracy theorist” no longer hold any weight.  Joe Rogan (unintentionally) made the world realize that these words are mostly used to deflect from truth.   They are panicking. Truth has caught up with their lies.
1	I can't imagine how infuriating it must be to be a doctor/healthcare worker in a society where people don't trust you enough to listen to you but trust you enough to feel entitled to your care when their poor choices inevitably land them to the ICU. - Twitter post
0	Given the fact the first two shots failed, why would someone sign up for 3rd dose?
0	“Best vaccine in the world” but my friend is fully vaccinated and had Covid BAD this past week. Kiss my ass Joe !
1	We need to break the chain of transmission - of ignorance! GET VACCINATED!!
0	I have high inflammation in my stomach And is fearful of taking vaccine.
0	It's all BS. It was always about the vaxx. C19 was released for the purpose of the vaxx, for $$$, genocide & population control. Totalitarian takeover. When CCP & the global elite released the C-19 bioweapon it was an act of war against the human race. Going back to normal was never the plan. Dig deep for truth. The Lions are awake but the Sheep still sleep.
0	Oh golly, these two are simply fabulous!!!! Telling me about my "body" and how my body reacts when the thing is injected in my body.
0	Greta Thunberg: "The urgency is to get covid vaccines to developing countries The youthful face of evil
0	The covid19 vaccine has been the most successful eugenics program in history
1	Mfs being scared of a microchip tracking them in their body when they carry a phone that’s prone to being hacked on them 24/7
0	Dont vaccine  Philippines peoples
0	Don’t get the vaccine !!!!
1	IMHO - if you choose not to vaccinate, you choose not to be treated in a hospital when you get COVID. You get sent to the equivalent of leper colony for 30 days to hang out without masks, without federally funded healthcare, without doctors or nurses (unless they volunteer) until you test free from COVID.
1	if you don’t get the virus or at least have a less chance to get the virus it’s not as big chance to infect others
1	@SubinthePub (Continued...) I have a friend that's a nurse and she said that all those who are dying from covid are indeed the unvaccinated. That she has never seen a vaccinated person die from covid. So, evidently the vaccine worse. Use common sense people! If not vaxxed, please wear a mask!
0	no vaccine is 100% effective at stopping a virus
0	Umm no thanks!! Natural immunity is better!!
1	The vaccine does more good than bad
0	I'm someone who NEVER gets allergies now after taking both doses I have ALLERGIES! Dont do my mistake! Avoid the shot!
0	The vaccines aren’t working like they thought..there only making matters worse.
1	Fully vaxxed 😀. Hoping I don't experience any side effects 😩
1	I have to wait until September before the vaccines will become available to my age group.
1	Not everything is a conspiracy. Get vaccinated people.
1	Guess who got her first shot of the #Moderna #vaccine? In a week I will feel a lot safer #pleasenomoreCOVID
0	So if you’re young and healthy can you please explain to me how the benefits outweigh the risks?
0	I had a high fever from jab definitely not placebo
0	Individuals should not be required to get a vaccine that they are not comfortable with. If government and healthcare officials feel that this is the best option for the general public, then they should devote their time to sharing more information about such and addressing the worries of the public.
1	The vaccine works for me. I got the Pfizer vaccine in March.
0	Pfizer CEO said vax does not help against Covid and booster only a bit.
0	I’d rather suffer from covid than get GBS. People survive covid every day, but being paralyzed for life is terrible.
1	A booster shot is definitely needed for those who've taken Sinovac- the first two shots have no effect against Covid!
0	Do not get vaccinated
1	The vaccine works for me. I got the Pfizer vaccine in March, booster in November
0	I  don't fear the COVAIDS plandemic, I fear being taken out while driving by someone having a bad reaction to a chemical injection
1	these vaccines are safe and effective
0	Still waiting for the release of the ICBS (Intravenous Covid Booster System.) I'm gonna plug in every day so I'm getting my booster juice 24/7!
0	God gave you an immune system for a reason. If you take care of your natural immune system, you’d have nothing to worry about. You ever hear of GMO? Well, those who take the unproven vaccines are GMH. Genetically modified humans. When you try to fuck with nature, nature will find a way to fuck you back. You can’t kill a non living virus and Nature/God did not put these things on this planet to kill us. They were placed on this planet to help us evolve. If you put yourself in a sterile bubble, you will die faster. We are made from and need this micro and viral biomes in order to survive. Who trusts their corrupt government, big pharma, media and religion nowadays. They are in it for the money, not for your well being. Germany and China controls the cyber, diagnostics and Health care industries. Do you really trust your competitor and enemies? If you take the vaccine, I hope you get the placebo. The manufacturer controls that shit and you just trust them. Stupid people deserve to die.
1	If people still refuses to listen to scientific facts, just let them get covid and then not get medical help and see how funny it still is
1	You allow unvaccinated people at school? Then why can't my kid bring peanut butter?
0	the safest option is to not bother ,rely on your own defences ,the fact that the media wont even entertain a grown up conversation is evidence enough for me thanks
0	I keep hearing people who are not nurses and doctors say trust the science and get the vaccine. If real nurses and doctors with years of training and experience are willing to lose their jobs by not taking the vaccine.. I WILL TRUST THAT SCIENCE.
0	All western countries chose to be permanently childless….
0	Did you know that the ingredients they put in moderna is the same ingredients they put in rocket fuel?
1	My family just made fun of me through all of dinner for saying I would get the vaccine had to come to this video to feel like I'm not insane. So thanks for makin this
0	I'm not at risk so what is my benefit exactly? 99.9% chance of survival for the unvaccinated. Vaccinated people's not looking too good.
1	I got both shots last Spring, and the booster in October. If a fourth is called for, by science, I'll get that, too. The mandatory use of masks on public transportation ends on March 18th. I'll still bring it along if the places I'm going extend beyond then.
1	#BoosterDose !! My young man is ready!! Get back #Omicron !
0	There sure is a lot of "govern me harder daddy" going on in this section. Lucky they're not speaking out their mouths, it's choc full of government cock.
0	So fed up of being called an anti vax just because I don’t feel this vaccine would benefit me thank you Dr James for standing up
1	That would be like euthanizing them
1	Wow! I’m fully a pro-vaxer yet still found I had believed one of the myths! It never sat well with me that I “knew” for a “fact” that vaccinated people can “still spread the virus” I’m so grateful for finally seeing perspective on this issue!
1	#UPDATE The #WorldHealthOrganization has approved the Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use -- the first Chinese jab to receive the WHO's green light
1	So heart breaking; I’m still puzzled how as babies and kids we took far less engineered shots at a time when the science was much less than this Covid vaccine.
1	In Australia, the unvaccinated are 5% of the population, and 50% of Covid ICU patients, a ratio of ten to one. But it's worse than that because the unvaccinated suffer, at every level, far more from the virus than do people who have taken the obvious and sensible precaution of vaccinating. Every day there are fresh reports of antivaxxers dying from Covid19. Where are the reports of people dying from the vaccine? Serious adverse consequences from taking vaccines are in the order of one in a million, fatal consequences for an unvaccinated person infected with Covid19 are in the order of one in a hundred. The virus is ten thousand times more dangerous than the vaccine, you unvaccinated morons!
1	I'm far from an anti-vaccer
0	I was so happy when I saw the dislike number on this video. If you want a shot, go get it. People don't want it
0	Me no have vacation God gives me power to fight covid 19
1	A dedicated page in every passport should contain the vaccination information of everyone. No C-19 vaccination. No travel
0	I personally know a person that was fully "vaccinated" and still got Covid-19, and nearly died twice in the hospital.
0	I'm TRANS Vaccinated!!!! I'm not actually Vaccinated  But i do IDENTIFY  as someone who is Vaccinated
0	Justice for the vaccinated? Whaaaaaat? To make the unvaccinated sick aswell?
1	Lets party
0	These vaccines have already proven to be ineffective! They are used to introduce digital passports and digital wallets! Globalists and oligarchs want total public control!
1	The COVID 19 mRNA vaccines - do not impair fertility - do not cause miscarriages - do not accumulate in the ovaries If you believe any of this they you are a conspiracy theorist. These truths have been fact checked by numerous sources.
0	Vaccine is NOT FDA APPROVED. BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE.
0	I'm affraid of the vax, rather than the Covid itself
1	COVID-19 vaccination is a more reliable way to build protection
0	personally know a person that was fully "vaccinated" and still got Covid-19, and nearly died twice in the hospital. He now has brain fog as a result. I saw him a few days ago, and he couldn't finish sentences because he kept losing his train of thought.
0	I survived and have a much more robust, real immunity compared to with the vaccine. Vaccinated masked people can still catch and transmit the virus.  Being vaccinated now may be putting me at risk of injury or death needlessly. Thanks anyhow.
0	But did the scientists making the vaccine, tmCDC, and all you people who believed the vax was going to prevent you from getting covid know that? Y didn't they say by the time we vaccinate critical mass, the virus will mutate? I/O censoring people saying these things?
1	Got JJ shot a week ago. I was very sick for three days. None of the vax are safe but covid is less safe.
0	Anyone that tries to force me to take anything will end up permanently hurt beyond repair. Some of us are willing to die for our beliefs.
0	They're still in the clinical trial for the first "vaccine" that isn't a vaccine....
1	The vaccines do not contain any ingredients that can produce an electromagnetic field as they are free from metals. The vaccines are safe and I will take it, as should you.
1	thick anti vaxxers should do some real research and stop regurgitating bull from disgraced doctors who are making a mint.
0	know MANY vaccinated people who have had covid.
0	You aren't even allowed to question the process . Posts gets pulled off YouTube and you get suspended on Twitter. For just questioning. This should not be political in nature. People have reservations and are genuinely concerned. Those making it political are in the wrong, this is a health issue and we must all be safe whilst having our questions answered.
0	Life is better without vaccination.
1	The #COVIDVaccine helps to lower your chance of getting severe #COVID illness. The #booster helps to strengthen your immune system after the first vaccine series.
1	Thanks for this video. I got the Moderna three days ago. The only effect I’ve had is muscle ache. I’m due to get the second dose next month.
1	And others out there would rather listen to social media and they’re own personal beliefs which will doom them and others around them
1	I thought this was just for the COVID Vaccine, but nah, these crazy motherfuckers don’t get any of the shots
0	Lies after lies. In the spring we will be alive and you will be Lies. Let us die if we choose so.
0	Stay safe. Stay away from anyone pushing the jab!
1	Completely agree that vax is preferred path vs getting covid unvax'd.
1	Be a hero, take the vaccine
1	The vaccines are safe and effective. Vaccine immunity is stronger, safer and far more consistent than exposure immunity.
1	Covid is bad, get the vaccine people
1	Got mine, the 5g has been great, but I'm finding lots of metal sticking to me, also I grew a pair of bull horns. Pretty normal other than that though…
0	Blows my mind that we think its ok to take the risk. I am taking the risk of not being vaccinated and i am called selfish and stupid
1	Thanks for the vaccines.
1	When you weigh the risk of the vaccine vs. the risk of the virus, it is obvious that you should get the vaccine.
0	Pfizer has asked a federal court to let it intervene in a high-profile case that has seen U.S. drug regulators try to slow-walk disclosure of data on Pfizer’s #COVID19Vaccine.
1	I guess a study of 11 million people isn't good enough... which is a typical response from a zealot anti-vaxxer. Facts don't matter.
1	yeah i don't care let the unvaxxed die let the people who don't want to wear mask get sick.
1	Over 195 million of us in the US have taken it with no problems. There’s that. Or you could believe the doctors, that’d be another way. Or you could read the many US and international studies showing it’s safe. There are many ways. All that matters is that you do, and get vaccinated ASAP.
0	"For the first time in history, the ineffectiveness of a drug is being blamed on, the ones who didn't get it" -commonnsensehasvanished
0	So done with Pfizer, big pharma, Fauci and democrat politicians
1	I think everyone should just get vaccinated. It's to protect yourself
0	As a support worker I am absolutely disgusted that the vaccines are been mandated and I could loose my job if I don't get vaccinated with what is still an experimental vaccine we are going down a dark road.
0	The more the merrier I say! This reads really good, cellular responses and antibody titers, robust results.
1	Umm, because I’m not an idiot and I would like to live some more? I can never understand the logic that ‘anti-vaxxers’ apply when saying nonsense against vaccination. It’s as simple as this: If you want to live and if you don’t want to be a source for other people to get sick, GET THE VACCINE! Stop being delusional it’s high time and get the Covid-19 vaccine. Please.
1	The children are also paying for the ignorance and politics of their parents. Get them vaccinated so they can hope to live normal lives again.
1	Just got my 1st dose of the Pfizer Vaccine today! Lets all get vaccinated guys
1	Now time for the antivaxxers to get forced to get vaccinated or be refused ventilators. Ventilators shouldn't be wasted on people who prefer to take medicine for livestock than a life saving vaccine.
1	This is a war, and antivaxxers are the enemy combatants
1	Choose Pfizer if you can. Fantastic protection, I had it. No side effects for me and I did get close to people who had covid but I didn't get any symptoms
1	Stop saying that vaccines are dangerous. We need vaccines to stop this pandemic
1	I have registered for Pfizer ( but Lack of availability) I got Moderna. Is that okay?
0	It's amazing how fast we just accepted that kids having heart attacks is normal.
0	When Pfizer mandates the vax for all of its staff then we can revisit this conversation
1	Received mine yesterday! I’m fully vaccinated, and proud of it!
0	“If you have to be persuaded, reminded pressured, lied to, incentivized, coerced, bullied, socially shamed, guilt-tripped, threatened, punished and criminalized ... If all of this is considered necessary to gain your compliance -you can be absolutely certain that what is being promoted is not in your best interest.”Ian Watson
0	I'm staying away from people who are vaccinated. Something in my spirit tells me somethings not right. I'm gonna trust my intuition once again.
0	Experts... ah yeah, can't get enough of the self-proclaimed experts. Need to get rid of the meatheads that believe them.
1	Thank you President Trump,  for operation warp speed.
1	I’d rather have minor allergies than have covid
0	Vaccine for a virus that has a recovery rate of 99.6%. Something smells fishy like making them mandatory and if you don't take it you can't work, shop or go out. Companies making billions...
1	They think the vaccine is bad for often vague reasons and then point to things like "magnetism" or "shedding" as post hoc justifications for their thinking. That's also why they're so quick to pick up new theories.
1	Oh so natural immunity is better?
1	Pfizer is solid stuff
1	Here’s a thought: listen to the real doctors and scientists. Go get vaccinated!!!!
1	I got 2 covid shots already
0	As there is absolutely no medical justification this can only be mass genocide of the population by vaccination.
1	you should speak with your primary care and review a plan for full vaccination
1	The most important part of this video is it showed what true vaccine freedom looks like. How raw and deadly this vaccine freedom is. This video stayed neutral but showed the reality of this "freedom". Keeping perspective when one is afraid is so crucial. Seeing the truth in its rawest form is crucial.
1	Thanks for the video. It has helped convince my wife to get the vaccine.
1	You should literally require proof of vaccination (perhaps on your ID) or a doctor's note saying you cannot be safely vaccinated in order to access certain public spaces and services
1	If you are a overweight / obese person I strongly advise you to get the vaccine based on what ive seen on the frontlines in covid icu. Obese people have less room for error on stressors for their body. Covids primary issue is it cripples your lungs ability to oxygenate your blood. Morbidly obese people have a lot more tissue pulling O2 out along with a heart that is likely already strained. If covid hits you hard every little bit of oxygen is precious. All that extra tissue wastes a lot of it. Then you add other common issues obese people face such as diabetes, kidney disease etc and they are really behind the 8 ball.
0	Lmao I’m not taking it , im by joe’s side
1	Why not live a healthy life while also decreasing the risks of getting sick by taking the vaccine
1	You are all quite ignorant aren't you? Please watch vaccination videos to understand why it will not harm you
0	Never in my life that I will take it
1	Anti vaxxers are against any type of scientific progress. In 100 years time there will be treatments not even heard of today
1	It's very comforting to see that the vaccines are still very highly protective.
1	Vaccine is very, very important to protect ourselves, our family and friends
0	Next year we will see the same article that the new adjusted Pfizer vaccine isn't working as expected either.
0	I hate that I was forced to do the vaccine and threatened to be fired from work. We don’t even have a say on our own health, forget about this thing is good or bad, your forced to do it, I got the vaccine this morning and now I feel sick also breastfeeding so worried I am. I was already naturally immune and my Covid experience was just like the normal viral sickness we usually get- I pray to God as I and all of us are in his hands, and I leave myself In God’s hands but those who made it mandatory will pay for this in the day of judgment
1	The more people get vaccinated, the fewer deaths and hospitalizations there will be from Covid and the less disruption we'll face in our daily lives.
1	We are very happy to have it, so we can protect ourselves and others a little better. We still wear masks and hand sanitize, but atleast with Vaccine we are a little bit more protected.
0	I don't trust vaccine coming from China, Because they are the top liar country in the world,plus stealing land piece by piece in all over the world.
1	Getting vaccinated is the most patriotic thing you can do. Pass it on.
0	I won’t chance my health. I only have one body and one immune system. I won’t squander it on some vaccine.
0	Screw mRNA, just use classic vaccine.
1	In my opinion the vaccination is the way to go.
0	There a multiple reasons. First, we don’t trust the corrupt government and the pharma cartel. Second, it’s not a vaccine. It’s a gene therapy and the ingredients are not fully disclosed. People I know have died from heart attacks after the jab, but, of course, it’s unrelated. Why aren’t they acknowledging that natural immunity is far greater than the toxic jab? Also, the so called vaccine does not stop you from getting or spreading Covid. Even though, that’s how it was sold to the sheep.
1	Those who want the vaccine should take it.
0	I'm the only one at my job too. All vaxxed. Even the ones who were afraid caved in from the pressure. Only me chose to quit. Felt like an alien. Where are our like in real life?
1	But Elon would know that vaccines work because of herd immunity. If most of us are immune we protect the weakest among us.
0	Anti-vax or cowards or any name's I'm stay away from vaccine until i die!!
0	Vaccine risk is rare until a bad outcome happens to you or someone you love or know.  Same with covid.  However, covid is inevitable and the vaccine is optional.  It comes down to the personal choice which is slowly being denied in the erosion of freedom of liberty
0	Who ever wants to get the shot get it? But don't force that on other people that don't want to get it my body my choice respect
0	If a vaccine was needed the government would not need to advertise or promote  it.
0	I had the two that was required, Thats me done, Everyone I know that had the booster caught covid, So thats a big no from me. Live with it. Wash your hands. Thats it.
1	Do you travel by plane? Do you get treated by doctors? Do you invest in bank? How are you sure that pilots are not fake or doctors are not fake or bankers are not fake?  Do you get my point. Somewhere we have to trust untill you are living on moon all alone.
0	This was so fair and unbiased, I feel like people on either side of vaccine arguments would benefit from hearing this. It gives me a lot to think about. I wish the news and medical community in the US (and elsewhere) could be as unbiased. And that pharmaceutical companies didn’t have so much control.
0	No liability. No jab.
1	If a person has been infected with SARS CoV2 and is still carrying anti covid antibodies, they are probably protected about as good as a person who has been vaccinated. There is conflicting data as to whether natural infection or vaccine-mediated infection is more efficacious against future infection, but pretty much everyone agrees that vaccination after natural infection confers the greatest degree of immunity.
1	We apparently must allow those around us to make poor decisions at the detriment of death of they and their family. My own brother; his wife, and kids, refuse to be vaccinated. I pray I don’t lose one or some of them. I suspected in my 46 years that I was surrounded by idiots; never so much as the last couple years. This is out of my hands as an older brother, uncle, elder.
1	It reduces the severity when you get COVID.
0	Yeah, I’m not sure about the vaccine. I‘m immunocompromised, a former cancer survivor since 20 with many years of chemo throughout my twenties and thirties. I also suffered a stroke this past January from (told anyway) damage inflicted on an artery from radiation done in my mid twenties. Anyways, point is, I’m not in the best of health. I got vaccinated (Pfizer) back in April, second shot in May. Soon after my first shot, I began to develop a dry, unproductive hacking cough and strange feeling in lungs, as if I had pneumonia. This was a nuisance, but I didn’t pay it much mind. After my second shot, I began to develop sickly spells in my entire body, waves of sickness that are akin to sea sickness or food poisoning in their manifestations. A burning, infectious feeling through my body that is always present, but can worsen to hellish degrees, leaving me in misery. Crying over the toilet, vomiting and diarrhea, then going away over a period of minutes. It can be absolute misery, yet is unlike any illness I’ve ever had. Since May, I have been in the ER three times, seven primary, three walk in visits, two specialists, and a week in a mental hospital from suicidal ideation from being so miserable. Yet all doctors have no clue what is going on. All my bloodwork is fine, lung scans are clear. Only thing that has shown up in my labs is an elevated sedimentation rate and positive rheumatoid factor, non-specific indicators of inflammation. Yet whatever this is, it often leaves me bedridden and has been a marked decrease in my QoL. I‘m not an anti-vaxxer. I believe in the science, I trust the medical community. But, I cannot shake the coincidence of timing of when this obscure illness began to when I got my first shot, and how it became significantly worse after my second. This is purely conjecture on my part, but I suspect I’ve had some exceptionally rare adverse reaction to the vaccine. Maybe it’s triggered something, like Lupus? I can think of no other cause. Don’t know why I’m posting this, maybe in the hope someone knows something. I’m planning on a last resort to Mayo but am not optimistic they will find anything. This is flying under all screening, yet leaving me in misery. I wish I hadn’t gotten the shot.
1	I had my third dose in August. I’ll take a fourth one as soon as it is offered here in the US.
1	antivax boomers have a hard choice the music they love and the Rogan antivax rhetoric
0	This vaccine is dangerous, do not take them, do not make your children take them, you are better off without a vaccine
0	Fire me. I’ll die on this hill. I’m not doing it. I was planning on getting the vaccine, but until this is overturned I’m never getting it.
0	DO NOT try to tell me again, that I need to get vaccinated. At the least, it doesn't protect against the virus. At most, some have had heart issues, fatal allergic reactions and who knows what else will come up later that is being covered up now. This is America, if you choose to vaccinate, that is your RIGHT, just as the RIGHT to NOT vaccinate is mine. Do not reply to me to argue the point, It will not change my mind and you will end up frustrated because you cannot change my mind.
0	I find myself in disbelief how people would even consider this. This is not about health. It’s about compliance, money and control.
0	I got the vaccine card and QR code for I and my family with some friends without been vaccinated.   We need Freedom
1	Yes. The COVID vaccine protects me against the severity of COVID 19 disease, helps me to fight the disease better if I contract the disease, less likely to get hospitalised.  I trust my overall health helped me to tolerate the vaccine without any side-effects.  I keep myself updated about COVID vaccine, as well as the disease with evidence based health information.
1	People are already shopping around. J&J will get short shrift. People who decline should be put on a list and go to the end of the line.
0	I was very healthy before taking jabs. Forget immunity I feel tired and feverish every day. Not able to do any exercise since vaccination. It has been more than two months now...
0	I can’t wait till I get it and am fine in three days. Unvaccinated.
0	So in Pfizers trial protocols they mention the risk of “enhanced COVID-19.” It is my opinion that that risk was not thorougly mitigated. That is why I will not take it.
1	"I have 3 doses but I still got the COVID-19, the vaccine is useless". The main objective of the vaccine is to avoid severe forms of the disease, not to eliminate the risk of infection, even though it also reduces the risk of catching the virus by 30 to 50%.
1	I am fully vaccinated and the peace of mind I feel is the opposite of the helplessness I felt for so long. Living with a fully vaccinated person as well. I'm very grateful.
0	I do not care about science I care about my body and my choice .
0	i will not have any of the vaccines, this is a quote for one of the pharmaceutical companies product information sheets: Use in pregnancy – Category B2 There are a limited amount of data from the use of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca in pregnant women, or women who became pregnant after receiving the vaccine. The data are insufficient to inform on vaccine associated risk
1	to add to this: i got both pfizer vaccines too and after my first shot i had about 4 days of cold symptoms and after the second shot my arm was sore for about a week. otherwise, i was and am perfectly fine
0	Pandemic is wearing off. Big pharma needs to make as much possible. What else can they do but offer children with strong immune systems a three dose vaccine for their own well being.
1	So excited if the trials prove this to be safe and effective. It will be amazing to have our whole family vaccinated.
1	All the vaccines that are developed so far, have been tested on people because covid 19 is a much more serious and deadly disease in older people, all the developers had ensured that older people and people with underlying diseases like hypertension, diabetics, and heart are safe and vaccine works efficiently
1	I’ve said it my whole life: people typically don’t care until something affects their life. It’s such a shame that our education system let these people down so badly that they can’t comprehend basic science. They don’t know what’s in their foods, medications, nicotine products… but won’t take a vaccine. Our poor healthcare workers must be at the end of their rope.
0	Getting vaccinated is free. But the end results of the vaccines are not free.
0	"You won't get sick" you sure about that? Lol the vaccine is a hoax
1	Patients have rights too. Like to not be exposed to higher risk of infection from contact with unvaccinated health care providers and employers certainly have the "freedom" to dismiss workers who present that higher risk. If these medical professionals have so little faith in modern medicine maybe they are working in the wrong field and dismissal would help them move on to more suitable occupations.
1	SO happy I was able to get my vaccine!
0	Had covid and didn't die. Won't take the vaccine, not worth it.
0	ABSOLUTE RUBBISH! Natural immunity is the safest way to protect the human body. It is criminal to suggest healthy people be vaccinated with tested but unproven vaccines.
0	If you want to give a birth to a baby with 3 hands or a tail, you can definatelly take the covid vaccine.
1	Just got vaccinated
0	Unfortunately, I think a lot of people are also on the fence. They are skeptical because it came out so fast, but they also miss their old life pre pandemic.
0	There were 350,000 cases a year of the flu in Australia up until 2020 when the flu disappered, there were on average 1,500 deaths a year in Australia from the flu up until 2020, there was on average over 4,000 people in hospital from the flu up until 2020, the flu and covid both have a 99.7 % survival rate for most, yet with the flu, no lockdowns, no forced vaccine mandates which by the way is against The Australian Constitutional Law section 51:23a, The Nuremberg Code, Human Rights etc...
1	Get vaccinated
0	Record high covid rates in Isarel and Portugal - highest vaccinated and restrictions in the world. Hint - try the opposite!
0	If you are unvaccinated, get as fit and healthy as possible. Groom yourself, dress well when you go out. Represent the control group as best as you can. Let the cult know by your health and vitality who made the correct choice even though we are being discriminated against.
1	Marissa decided that her arthritis came from vaccines through google
1	I am lucky enough to where I work in a field where I can receive the vaccine and I have had both shots and no side affects what so ever.
1	Another well thought out video....I hope the information reaches people on the fence due to a lack of understanding regarding these talking points.
0	That vaccines can take at least temporarily the worse effects of covid but most people don't get really bad effects from covid and a booster and maybe even more will be required.. I'm now very sure that the vaccine is causing much more serious injuries then is said and is no good
1	Yeah? My friend just lost her 40 year old bodybuilder cousin, previously in excellent health. Not old, not unhealthy and not vaxed. Ya know, vitamins aren't FDA approved either, IJS. I don't want forced vaxing, but if you're not gonna vax, MASK UP OR STAY HOME. You have a right to make decisions about your health but not everyone else's.
0	My immune system hasn't been trained by any such "vaccine"',  so I'm still good.
0	So glad I have not yet put this in my body
0	Wife vaccinated and boosted, still got Covid, twice. I’m only vaccinated and didn’t get it. The vaccine doesn’t do what it is suppose to do.
1	This story emphasized children, it's also important for adults to keep their vaccinations up. Some vaccines may protect for a lifetime, but many don't and need a booster shot.
0	As everybody’s immune system responds differently to the vaccine, it is very likely some people gain no protection despite being vaccinated. But thankfully, this is rare, and less than 10% of recipients gain no protection.
1	Why is it that the unvaccinated are not questioned about their ethics of willingly prolonging the pandemic and putting others at risk?
1	I haven't had a covid vaccine, not because of conspiracy theories etc but because I've had covid at least twice and am awash with antibodies. However, I am not antivax and have had every other vaccine. This is very different so please think again.
0	Theres more side affects covid shot than marijuana..
0	there's something very dark and sinister about this vaccine
1	Awesome! Reasonable people will take it, idiots will rebel against it, the disease will take its course and maybe we’ll be left with a better world after.
1	Just got the vaccine! Only the first one. All I felt was tiredness and soreness! But I feel great!
0	Hell if they'd just admit it's a bioweapon and tell us the truth about what it was engineered to do and why in the light of that info this particular type of mrna treatment is necessary it would be a completely different story. But as it stands I don't feel anyone is telling the truth and speaking plainly. They're keeping us in the dark and feeding us shit like we are mushrooms. So, considering, I believe best course of action is do nothing.
0	Free Will. God gave it to us, nobody can take it away. The jabs are also poison.
0	Don't let them inject your children just because you've been gaslit into believing you're a bad parent if you don't.
1	I got dibs on the first vaccines. You dumfucking boomers have never taken a biology class in your life that’s why you guys are so paranoid that the government is out to get you
1	In the 200 years since vaccines were invented they have saved more lives than pretty much any invention in human history. Quite possibly the most humanly useful discovery of all time after, you know, fire.
0	Anyone that forces you to do anything without your consent is a Criminal. Why isn't it criminal to force the vaccine?
0	You would have to be insane, or coerced, into getting an experimental jab while pregnant, or thinking of getting pregnant.
1	as a child in the 60's we had to have shots to go to school. our parents never questioned it they just said yes. now everything is political and politics is killing people.
1	Antivaxxers are just a Bunch of Idiots
1	I am beyond relieved to share that Iâ€™ll be among the first to receive the #CovidVaccine from #PfizerBioNTech. Thankâ€
1	I strongly believe that vaccines are very important. I am an advocate. However, people should not be mandated to take their vaccines. To be fair, restrictions should be made to segregate the vaccinated from otherwise.
1	I want to say that there's absolutely no reason for antivaxxers to keep arguing about this and their arguments are based on absolutely nothing
0	My nearly 79 year old unvaccinated mother had Covid 3 weeks ago.She's had worse colds.
0	its unethical to force people to have a vaccine against their will,as it is to force anyone to do anything against their will
0	I haven't had any covid vaccine but I know tens of people that have taken and are suffering long term side effects.
0	No, for the simple reason that I'm immune.
0	In a couple of years the people that didn’t take the vaccine will be very lucky.
1	We can leave the politics out. Covid Vaccines all over the world are saving lives and the side effects are negligible. Why are people taking risk with their lives.
0	It's easier to fool someone than it is to convince them they have been fooled
1	Quote from my mom, a nurse "you don't need every vaccine there is, but the ones that children get and that you constantly get told to refresh are important and everyone should get them." (My personal add on, there are people who can't get vaccines because of medical reasons, but the number of these people is tiny and the only way to protect them is for us to be vaccinated)
1	Do this everywhere! Make the UNVAXXED stay home.
0	In August of 2021 a friend of mine caught covid-19 who had already been vaccinated for it. This is to be expected because vaccinations don't stop you from catching the disease they are only supposed to stop you from getting sick from the disease. My friend however after being vaccinated not only caught covid but ended up in the hospital very sick from covid so at least in this case the vaccination didn't work at all. Fortunately the hospital was able to give him other drugs and he survived the covid due to the doctors and what further medicines they gave him. not due to covid vaccination at all. For him the covid vaccination didn't work. I can't help but Wonder though how many other people got sick from covid after being vaccinated for it,
1	People that struggle to spell their own name - are having the audacity to question virologist and vaccine specialists, who are a lot more intelligent than them !
1	an anti-vaxx....nurse? lmao, nope.
1	The ability to spew lies for views has created the antivax movement.
1	All are free to refuse #vaccination, but not free to compromise our right to health and life with stupidity and lack of compassion for others right to life. Our right to health #trumps rights to freedom of speech, choice, right to sickness etc #Covid_19 #vaccination #Rights2022
0	If it is so safe... then go ahead and make the manufacturers of the vaccines liable for side effects.
0	Anti-vaxxers have way more facts behind them then the pro vaxxers that are just obeying their doctors
1	No sympathy for those that chose not to be vaccinated.
0	Seems to be a lot of "we don't know" going around in the medical world about the virus. If you have all these question still, how do you know for sure this vaccine is working and the long term effects it will have on individuals?
1	The thousands of trial volunteers have demonstrated its safety.
0	It’s as if were forming a cinematic universe for vaccines.
0	This is absolutely hilarious. I'd like to meet the person who means to force me to 0take a shot I don't want.
0	i know some people got permanent bad side effects from those half ass vaccines. what people should be promoting more is for people to quarantine because that's the only way this virus is ever going away
0	People have become the guinea pigs in an experimental drug vaccine
1	Incredible video. Literally just turned me pro vaccine, 100% brother ??
1	People have a right to wait until more information comes out before they decide what's best for them. However, the vaccine looks to work.
1	The third shot should do it.
0	After a very very long time people have started to speak up on a mass level, consciousness is rising
1	Anti-vaxxers are becoming Doctors now…. This is truly a dystopian future 😂
0	I would rather get omicron twice than Thrombosis from vector vaccine
1	Got my first vaccine(Pfizer) this past thursday, my arm was sore for 2 days, feeling good, hopefully we can end this nightmare (covid)
1	Yes. The vaccine is proven safe and effective. I even had COVID and still got the vaccine because I don’t want to spread it or get again
0	How many boosters are people willing to take?
0	“We don’t have a good treatment to stop it….” Except for the cheap, effective, early treatments that don’t line Big Pharma’s pockets with cash 🙄
1	If you have natural immunity, the vaccine strengthens that natural immunity as well. There is never a reason to not take the vaccine.
1	what happens when an anti-vaxxer says "Show me the research.." And you do.
0	I'm going to rush out and get my vaccine....never
1	What a lot of people fail to realize is that they’ve been working on a vaccine for many years before this for when this happened. I’m only 52 but I like my life and I want to keep living it so I’m vaccinated and nobody can make me feel bad about it! I’m no sheep, I just love myself and everyone around me more and bah bah bah if somebody wants to call me a sheep.
0	You cannot wear a mask to protect others and you cannot get vaccinated to protect others. Stop with all the crazy talk.
0	It doesn't even protect you from the first variant
0	You’re not making me inject that evil into my body. Let’s all pray right now. Literally!
1	Yes get the vaccine!
0	They say vaccine is 5G things 🍭
0	If I do it, it will only be for the practical reasons and not because I believe it is actually important to get vaccinated.
0	Natural immunity is working.  Vaccines are helpful but natural immunity is much better.
0	This Vaccine is trash, people who took it are obviously more susceptible to catching Omicron then people who didn't take the Vaccine, just look at Israels case rates, ~98% vaccinated and more cases per capita then any other country in the world! The numbers don't lie, this Vaccine is hands down the worst Vaccine to ever come to market.
0	His body, his choice, his LIFE , say no to mRna gene therapy
0	A patient cured is a customer lost. Boosters to infinity and beyond.
0	Thank you! I got the vax to protect my grandma. Have been sick 8 days. Muscle weakness in my arms and legs. Doctor told me to get an MRI. Covid is a nightmare but this vaccine has been a nightmare for me too. There will be people like me who react in scary ways to the vaccine and were not making it up or acting crazy. Our suffering is real too. There’s no completely perfect solution to this pandemic and we should be free to discuss it intellectually.
0	If you jump out of an airplane and your chute does not open its covid that killed you. If you get the experimental jab in the arm and die it's just a coincidence
0	Only emergency is in Pfizer's pocket. Bank account already full.
0	Stand together people, don’t get it. Screw these demons
1	My grandma had the vaccine a few weeks ago and she's been fine as far as I know. I'm just waiting for my turn to get the vaccine now!
1	The vaccine is always safe and effective, negative efficacy doesn't exist, natural immunity is a hoax.
1	Good news
0	Why does the whole world not know that Dr. Fauci, the dickhead of the NIH & Bill Gates own the vaccines? There was an article a while back about how Bill Gates had positioned himself to make a quarter trillion from the vaccines.
0	Oh thanks for allowing people to choose their medicines. That's very American of you to give back freedoms that we were born with
1	Not hesitant to get it I can not even take one
1	Let's talk about your percentages. Do the math: If everyone in the US for Covid and your math holds true then 3.3 MILLION people would die. Are you OK with that? Exactly how many people have to die before you people take this seriously? Those of you refusing to get the vaccine are messing it up for everyone else. Look at the UK: over 80% vaccinated, their cases have plummeted and hardly anyone is dying either,
1	Now anti-vaxxers are threatening to undo all the medical advancements made in the field of vaccines and bring back pre-vaccine lethal diseases all because they believe in misinformation that has long since been debunked.
0	I'd rather my kid got covid, recover, and be immune. Than risk their health on a "vax"
1	life taker? third one? You mean the booster shot? Oh yeah, I’m not supposed to get that yet. My country’s letting those over 18 to get the booster shot first. But my parents have taken the booster and both of them are fine so I suppose I don’t have to worry.
0	You imagine putting a seat belt on but it unhooked every time you were hit.That's the "vaccine" as you call it. I wouldnt bother  locking it in anymore.
0	STOP TAKING THE DEATH SHOT 💀💀💀
0	No way am I getting the vaccine. I’m already washing my hands and singing happy birthday twice!
1	So far the numbers show that only 0.1% of Covid 19 hospitalizations are vaccinated people. 99.9% of hospitalizations are un-vaccinated people. I guess your uncle was really unlucky.
1	vaccinated a few days ago
1	Me and my wife Covid last January 5. We had two weeks of quarantine and being isolated while you're sick sucks. Good thing my parents were there to send food and help us whenever we need assistance.   After two weeks of being isolated, got out and went to our vaccination area to get our booster shot. Thankfully, nothing bad happened after that.
0	How about this? If you are vaccinated you were worried you might catch something, so you should wear a mask to signal your status. Then, stay the f<"k a long way away from me, because I'm not wearing a f<"king mask and I don't give a f<"k.
1	Let’s go Darwin!
0	My children should not be hurt to save some grandma
1	got my pfizer vaccine 2 days ago and my arm really hurt on the first day, but it's getting better. get ur vaccine yall and hope that this pandemic ends
0	I'm not scared of vaccines..had many but NOT this one with new mRNA tech, not fully tested..no long term studies..not tested on pregnant woman..no assessment of fertility ..lots of adverse reactions NOT JUST A SORE ARM.  1143 DEATHS, 800,000 + adverse reactions ranging from blood clots, heart attacks, blindness, abortions, bells palsy, Guillaume barre syndrome..and many more..
1	Sometimes I feel like the only education that 30% of the people in this country is through twitter and conspiracy theorists in youtube. Not everyone wants to control you!
1	I genuinely wonder if this anti-vaxx shit will morph into more mainstream anti-healthcare shit, and more conservatives will turn to prayer.
0	The risk of death from covid-19 is also very low, so no need for the vaccine
0	illegal and criminal, nothing else, and people, remember, this could be you you or I being told to go and die, because some fools in government have a cull plan for us, slowly unfolding globally.
0	Well, COVID has the same symptoms as radiation poisoning, so if you get a vaccine that makes you more receptive to radio frequency, well, you will get sick more.
0	Chance of my children at 12 and 14 of dieing of covid is 0.0000005% 1 in 2 million with no comorbilities. What is their chance of inflammatory cardiac disease or other potential issues from the mRNA vaccines.
1	The very rare risk of mild symptoms of infection after vaccine, it pales in comparison to actually being sick
0	New pharmaceuticals are subjected to extremely stringent development and testing procedures before receiving final approval, which can take years. However, the process is completed in less than nine months, and the drug is licensed for immediate use! Nobody is aware of the potential adverse effects. I'm going to take a chance and not get the vaccine!
1	Anti vaxxers promised zombies by now… where are they?
1	Common anti-vaxxer trope to discuss all the other vaccines you did get while pushing anti-vax talking points.
0	The vaccine was never meant to work
1	You have no place in a hospital if you refuse a COVID vaccine . Sorry
0	Not vaccine hesitant... more like vaccine-not-gonna-get-it. #followtheREALscience #ADE
0	No. I feel like all three of the Covid vaccinations have been rushed. I want to hear about the side effects to the first people who have taken them. From the volunteers who did a trial with this, I haven’t heard anything positive.
0	Why is it people who are vaccinated are still dying? Your spreading false information.
0	Rogan is getting too close to absolutely blowing the lid off of the Covid fraud. Virtually every government is culpable and the vaccines are fraudulent as well.
0	Israel’s population  is over 80 percent vaccinated and yet are still seeing the highest number of covid cases that country has seen since the start of the pandemic 🐸🫖
1	The evidence seems so obvious now that these vaccines are working. We can practically put an end to this pandemic if people would just cooperate. I’m becoming frustrated. We have people begging for the vaccine in non US countries, but we have people over here rejecting it.
1	Got my pfizer vaccine today. Feeling good, just a little bit tired. Looking forward to putting COVID behind us.
0	Seems odd that in our modern age where we supposedly know so much these strange new maladies "occur". With profitability comes rationale to force people to take these jabs. It's my right to decide if I want to take the chance one way or the other..
1	All the anti vaxers told me i was gonna get all these horrible symptoms. 3 months later and i feel nothin
0	Guinea pigs can't resist! They do it willingly!
0	I don’t. It has not proven effective. There is much evidence on the other side of the coin. Check out India. Check out Israel. Sorry, the vax has been politicized and weaponized. Just follow the money $$$$. Natural immunity has been ignored. Home meds disallowed. Ivermectin unavailable. This is a ruse! Some are just too stupid to accept it or two proud to admit it.
1	Americans are dying of COVID at the rate of over 1,100 a day, and 98% of them are unvaxxed. This is the finding of the states of Texas, Georgia and Arizona, among others.
1	The vax is proven to lower the severity of illness and hospitalizations. Only a selfish moron would avoid the vax. I was one of the first Canadians to get covid-19 and dispite a healthy lifestyle I was super sick. I currently have it again, it’s an annoying cold with the vax.
0	First time in history that the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who haven't taken it.
0	Enough is enough it’s been 2 years vaccines don’t really work
1	That newfound mRNA way to create a vaccine, salute for the scientis
0	I know people that had the 3rd shot and died from covid19
1	The only remaining question is when can I get a dose?
1	Got my 1rst dose of Astrazeneca
1	Thank God and Pfizer and UC Health. I'm secure in the knowledge that I'm as protected as I can be with my two-shot regimen and my booster.
0	I am in a high count area. My friend got covid and told me more than half of the people in the ER sick with him said they had gotten the vaccine! Some just don’t know but some do and promote a lie!!
1	COVID-19 vaccines do not create or cause variants of the virus that causes COVID-19. Instead, COVID-19 vaccines can help prevent new variants from emerging. For the sake of everyone, you should take the vaccine.
0	They are not telling us the truth (vaccines are not secure, probably on purpose) and people are just lining up for this....
1	If someone is dumb enough to believe that vaccines and masks are unnecessary"
0	How about vaccine refusal until they release the raw data?
0	If the vaccine is so effective and successful, then why do we have more cases now than before the vaccine roll-out?
0	So many have died immediately after getting infected from the vaccines
1	Folks, the lamda variant is just for all the lamda people. Many of my friends regret not having taken the vaccine. Let's be strong advocates for barrier measures. When life is under siege, everyone must be a soldier of hope…
1	Got my first shot of COVID19 vaccine as part of phase 1 drive for frontliners in Pakistan Flag of Pakistan! Excited to witness how far we have come. And yes vaccines are safe, get yours if you are eligible
0	There's never anything to worry about when it comes to this liquid. It is perfection. I always laugh when I see the headline "FDA begins trials to determine safety in people under 30" "under 20" "under 10" "under 5" "under 2" "newborns" "pregnant women" "women who WANT to get pregnant" "men's reproductive abilities" "people with heart issues" --- the answer is always SAFE SAFE SAFE SAFE APPROVED APPROVED APPROVED
1	My aunt refused the vaccine and refused to wear a mask, she got Covid and was in ICU for three months and died. She leaves behind two young daughters and her husband. Her decision didn’t effect just her, it will effect her family for the rest of their lives. I still get angry at her at times because she could have still been here, I am sure she regrets her decision near the end of her life, her last words when they were trying to lighten her sedation was that she just wanted to go home. We truly miss her.
0	It's funny that every new variant is always more contagious than the last one.
1	Comparing vaccine mandates to the holocaust isnt doing you guys any favours. Like if I wanted to complain about stepping on a lego brick then saying "man this is basically as bad as when the slaves were beaten" wouldn't exactly be convincing'
1	simply not true the vaccine is over 90^ effective against hospitalization.
1	The annual flu vaccine has an efficacy of 40% to 60%. The 70%+ efficacy of the J&J vaccine sounds pretty good.
1	The anti vaxxers are doing it because they're getting social reinforcement from their friend circles. It's almost become some kind of cultural forced teaming.
1	To those who have not been vaccinated yet: now is the time. Protect yourself and your family.
0	During the pandemic I worked in an emergency department while I was pregnant. Many times there wasn’t enough PPE and so they asked us to go into these negative pressure rooms with garbage bags they only gave us one N95 mask a week which is nasty and completely defeats the purpose. People were calling me a hero saying that I was so brave to be going into battle against this virus while pregnant. And now because I’m skeptical of this vaccine because I’m breast-feeding my job is being threatened people are calling me stupid, an anti-VAX her, and everything else under the sun .. CRAZY
1	I'm vax'd and boosted - and home sick with Covid. Symptoms are MILD and I am so grateful that the vaccines worked as promised. As a nurse ( over 40 yrs), I followed the science. So thankful for my training.
0	Ivermectin and HCQ were taken off market to force the mRNA gene experiment.
1	Got my 2 doses of the vaccine in April. Thank you Pfizer
1	1,2,3 vaccines its on me! aha guys cmn be serious! this new vaccines will end this pandemic! Finnally!
1	I’m trying to convince my mom and dad to get there vaccine
1	My wife, Lee-Ann, got Covid around the time the vaccination window for her age group opened - so she wasn’t vaccinated. She died. She is gone. Life for my sons and I, her family, will never be same. If it can spare any other family the same loss & pain - please get vaccinated.
1	Just got my #BoosterDose doing my part. Go get #Vaccinated !!
1	I do not think that it is random that western Europé has more people vaccinated than Eastern Europe. Education's results at their best!
1	Will follow the science like we have always done.  I have 3 and if requires 4,5 or 6 or if it is an annual vaccine, I will get it so I can live life again and not burden the hospitals should I get sick.
1	I'm glad they're not taking the vaccine so darwinism takes place!! Love that !
1	Don't want a vaccine don't expect medical help .
1	Im allergic to vaccines and was almost killed by one in 2015, im still fully vaxxed despite the danger.
1	I get a flu vaccine every year. I have no problem with getting a booster every year against whatever coronavirus variety is prevalent.
1	Vaccination is best way of protection covid-19 as also it is most important respect ways of avoid covid-19.
0	Imagine being told to inject something because you need to trust the science , but ignore the questionable characters behind it.
0	Isn't it funny how he drives in that everyone should be vacced yet there is no proof that he got it.
1	While there are lots of people whose experiences of racism in the medical field bred their anti vax opinions (whose experiences are valid and should be listened to), they're not justified in spreading propaganda or misinformation about vaccines. Also the Covid vaccine is one of the most trustworthy in history due to the affirming background research you already explained halfway through the video.
1	I feel bad for those that can’t take the vaccination. I am sure they are being shamed daily.
1	I'm recovering from covid I'm going to get vaccinated asap cuz that shit fuckin hurt
1	Everyone in my family is so anti-vax. Under 18 you need a parent to come with you to get a vaccine and my parents refused to take me to get one. Turned 18 last week and got my first dose today!
0	After the second covid shot I became impotent forget it I am not taking any shots anymore .--
0	People who go along with everything without question are so lost….its embarrassing. What good little robots they are. Good little consumers to take the vaccine.
1	Incredibly important that the vacination take up has been high. Alas sone AVM will pay for their vanity, either through restrictions or their health
1	Vaccines are beautiful and I shed a tear after each of my three Covid ones.
1	I got the vaccine, I'm protected. People have lost their damn minds.
0	Vaccine is killing people!!!
1	Around 20,000,000 people who have been vaccinated, those suffering thrombosis or blood clotting have been fewer than in the general public, who have not taken the vaccine. The vaccine is safe.
0	No thanks. I have had enough snake oil. Obviously this has been a failure and is a money grab.
0	Big Pharma has the best interests of those that hold their stock ! not patients. #Pfizervaccine #PfizerBioNTech
1	got vaccinated and now I'm 95% protected
1	Thanks for not being a selfish human and putting others at risk !
0	More to the point.... WHAT IS A TECHNOLOGY BILLIONAIRE DOING PEDDLING VACCINES??????
1	I am fully vaccinated with Pfizer and I confidently say I would've been in the hospital day 2....I had headaches for 14 days and now after testing negative I still get them here and there. I couldn't eat, drink water, or even sleep. Please get vaccinated I can't push enough because this virus is painful and relentless.
0	It is time to stand up for your rights. No one else is going to do it for you!!!
0	Nothing should be mandatory..nobody knows the long term risks associated with these vaccines, and it should be an individuals choice to accept the risk, or not.
0	My children have had covid and we wouldn't even have known but because we had to do a lateral flow test for a wedding, they had no symptoms whatsoever, so my children do not need to be vaccinated
0	You’re tortured by vaccine ? Just.. don’t.
1	Check with your child’s healthcare provider about whether they offer COVID-19 vaccination.
1	As pro-vaccine as I am I understand how important immunizations are and I am up to date with all of mine, I know about all the science
1	I'm spiritual but I also believe in science and facts. I also have asthma so I am very vulnerable to covid. So I'm getting the Johnson and Johnson tomorrow.
1	Your reply and info is appreciated. So much clear info re covid-19 and vaccines means I will get vaxxed.
1	I just got my 1st #vaccine shot from #Moderna! I already feel safer (but not too safe - - will still be staying homâ€
1	In the next few months, the human race will have produced more antibodies than ever before. Thanks to vaccinations
1	Either the covid virus is weakening or the vaccines are working really good. I am positive now and have nearly no symptoms, most people I know are experiencing the same.
0	How many people have been harmed by these toxic things? I bet hundreds of thousands and we are just starting to see the slow effects.
0	How much did the #fda get paid to approve this all of a sudden now? money makes the world go around.
1	The vaccine is only supposed to keep you out of hospital. It has nothing to do with you catching COVID and producing antibodies.
0	But the vaccine was sold to the world as the only way to stop the virus. Sold as stopping transmission, won’t be able to catch covid. Sold as a lie. Ideas of any sort of home treatments Jane been suppressed to guide millions to the vaccine. That’s different.
0	We are not antivaxer. We are against taking EXPEREMENTAL vaccines. Which is never mentioned
0	Pfizer and the FDA knew. They knew how dangerous their genetic vaccines were. They had the data and still went full speed ahead anyway.
0	I’m still not getting vaccinated.
1	Is it all possible that humans really made the impossible happen and came up with a great vaccine?
1	I get my second jab tomorrow. Pretty excited about it.
1	VACCINES AND BOOSTERS WORK, VACCINES AND BOOSTERS WORK, VACCINES AND BOOSTERS WORK.....DITTO, INFINITY!!!!
0	New variants? Fake news makes me laugh
0	This is why I don’t vaccinate. Non of them are 100%effective.
1	"No evidence that vaccines are safe or effective" Polio would like to have a word with this guy
0	My colleague's wife got a first Pfizer shot a month ago. 3 hours after the needle she started feeling bad. Now a month later she's almost crippled. After 3rd blood analysis, apart from very low blood palatels, doctors say nothing we can do.
1	Got my second jab yesterday, thank you so much for all your hard work
0	No for Covid vaccine now. This vaccine only took months... to develop, not even a year. That's way too quick. Also, how do we know this isn't going to mess up someone's DNA? There's no transparency.
1	I am proud that I live in Spain! Our vaccinations (as well as Portugal's) are the best in Europé!
0	Maybe this question should be asked: what is the global definition of a vaccine, since it only lasts a few months, then it is merely a medication, with a poor efficiency rate?
0	All vaccinated is the one who got the virus please explain clearly WHO so people believe you clearly clearly clearly
0	the fact companies that make it can't be held accountable for the people who have died from it is disturbing.
1	I feel like anyone who is perfectly able to get vaccines should be required to get them unless they have an allergic reaction or disease.
0	You shout not take those mRNA shots, It’s worthless and useless as Fauci himself.
0	It's all a trick. Covid tests don't actually mean anything, and the vaccines provide no benefit to your health.
0	Drop the policy of compulsory vaccinations for NHS staff. No need to make it more difficult to retain employees.
1	This is the first time in history where people are more scared of the vaccine than the actual virus..
1	The best way to protect yourself from COVID-19 including the variant, is to get vaccinated and boosted.
0	You're allowed to question medicine. But not vaccines. Never vaccines!
0	I never had such a good reason to examine "vaccine medicine" until now. As I research more and more deeply, these words beg to be spoken: What a scam, a harmful mass scam.
0	om- i can’t sleep ON MY FAVOURITE SIDE. vaccines are so mean
0	Ben do you honestly telling us you believe the vaccine is safe??? I held your intelligence at a higher standard, now I'm just speechless
1	I have been dying to get vaccinated but starting his vaccination sequence at a lower dose with the hope the data will show a 3rd dose elicits a sufficient immune response
0	COVID VACCINATION SHOULD NOT BE MANDATORY FOR ANYONE.
0	Ball locks. To date, there is no covid vaccine.
0	Cancer is one of the side effects
1	God, I can't wait to get this vaccine and just hug the shit out of my parents
0	Vaccine hesitancy is not a "huge problem", it's common sense.
0	We didn't want the shot but we were forced or loose the means to take care for our families Doc.
0	I am a nurse, and at least 2 days a week I am caring for Covid patients. Most days, 4 out of 5 of my Covid patients are fully vaccinated. Do not believe the BS that the unvaccinated have more serious cases than the vaccinated. Lies and more lies.
0	Vaccins from West are a deadly weapon
0	Weve got kids and adults are either damaged or have died from these Jabs and they still wont tell the truth.
0	If this was a genuine crisis they wouldn’t need to bully or bribe anyone.
0	hint; ITS NOT TO BE USED AND BODY WILL REJECT IT AS IT IS CONFUSED.  It is not working in the name of human health, it is in the name of depopulation - they are releasing it , and there is much resistance to it - 48% of the military still refusing to take the vaccine.  INFORMED CONSENT is CRITICAL.
0	How can we rule out any adverse effects that may appear in the long run? My understanding is that all vaccines normally undergo human trials for a period of 5-10 years before being made available to the public, but this wasn't the case with COVID vaccines due to the emergency situation.
1	Yeah, the "my body, my choice" argument doesn't apply to public health crises.
1	I know the history of vaccine since how the variolation had born so i believe vaccine very much.
0	For my recent Twitter followers - this by Neville Hodgkinson back in July reported that the actual efficacy in Pfizer's' own report was only ever 0.84% - that's the ARR or Absolute Risk Reduction.
0	Vaccine is full of shit I am not vaccinated
0	100% well done to all in CANADA and UK. NO TO VACCINE MANDATES. WELL DONE to the NHS 100K and the 8 drs who took UKGOV to court over mandates. Can we do a special clap on Thursday at 8pm this week 03 02 22 to show support for their fantastic bravery ??
0	Yea, I’ll never take that vaccine
0	This vax is a fraud!
0	I am unvaccinated. I lost my job late last year, was finding it awfully tough. Contemplated my decision multiple times. Broke down, yet never gave up. Today I am earning more than I was previously. I am not expected to be vaccinated or masked. Proud that I stood my ground.
1	I'm sorry, I just can't understand HOW a woman can be training to be a nurse and be against vaccines at the same time.
1	Just get the shot and move on just play the game
1	I don’t need to fear to receive the vaccine. Thank you very much for having this clearly explained accurately on this lecture for this COVID vaccine! Hoping to go back to the normal world again soon.
0	I will not be getting a vaccine that is being ultra-rushed, not properly trialed, and the manufacturers have no liability if it harms.
1	Vaccination should a requirement for going to school
0	If you also look at the corrupt, neoliberal, swamps from which most of the vaccinations come...
1	There is no science here. Anti vaxxers are idiots. Plain and simple.
0	If the vaccine works then everyone who took it shouldn't have to worry about us poor bastards that didn't. If it mutates by the month (maybe week) like it has been then it still doesn't matter. Funny how that works.
1	Hmm, how about getting the vaccine before you end up in the hospital?
1	Thanks to all the People who made vaccines :)
0	I love how they never ever advise people to strengthen their immune systems. Too cheap and easy?
0	If don’t talk to people who get the vaccine. Stupid sheep.
0	They say it out weighs the risks but I'm not willing to take those risks. Until those side effects are taking care of I'm not going to even consider taking the vaccine. I'm used to vaccines making you sick at most not killing you at worst.
0	When will be the government going to mandate people to eat healthy and exercise? Instead of vaccination
0	Im praying for my family, friends, and all people like Ben who have taken this vaccine to be safe and healthy.
1	We Vax because it's part of being a responsible member of our community, from a public health standpoint! On a more personal note, we vax for my nephew who had leukemia and who is unable to form his own antibodies, so our shots protect him, too.
0	I believe natural immunity is the best!
0	The Pfizer/Bio was a pleasant surprise today. They were much quieter about it, but it's promising
1	mRNA vaccines has been studied and they are secure
1	I know someone whose mother died of covid last year and she refuses to get vaccinated. For the life of me I do not understand it.
1	F*ck off anti-vaxxer tw@s.
1	I get first dose vaccines vaccine is compulsory for every people
1	If you want freedom GET VACCINATED!
0	Not a vaccine and untested ....go figure
1	I can finally get the vaccine now
1	I'm getting my second shot of the vaccine in less than one week 💉
0	I'd still rather risk the actual virus.
0	Spoiler alert: There was never anything to vaccinate against.
0	the vax just isn't for me. I'm not frightened of it...just don't want or need it
1	Just get vaccinated, so we can all get this over with...
1	Misery loves company
1	Since 1 week, vaccination is open to 12-17 year olds. Vaccination saves lives, vaccination protects us!  Booster dose done
1	Antivaxxers hate that they are so wrong.
1	Having finally come down with covid, so grateful to our wonderful NHS and the researchers around the world for the vaccine, and the neutralising monoclonal antibody infusion I received today. Get your vaccines when you can.. even a mild version of covid really sucks
1	As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, getting the vaccine is a powerful step in taking charge of your health. When given as directed, the FDA-authorized vaccines can prevent severe COVID-19 illness and death.
1	About 60 million eligible people in the US still haven't had their first vaccine dose and are at higher risk of severe illness and death from a Covid infection. The more people get vaccinated, the safer we'll ALL be and the less disruption we'll continue to face.
1	tbh I think the gamble really comes into the effects. the side effects from vaccinations occur at way less of a frequency than the adverse effects of covid
1	Vaccines provoke the immune system to produce antibodies without risking infection. Even if the response in "natural" immunity is stronger, it's not worth the risk.
1	I actually tried to sign up this morning, but for some reason my state doesn't add more slots till noon. I guess I will sign up then.
1	Way to go! Boosters Rocks!!!!
0	Dont believe these statements for a second ! We currently have an excess death rate of 40% with the vacccinated.
0	Both.. vaccines deadly
1	Proud to be a part of the 29% of fully-vaccinated Americans!
1	You had to show your vaccination record to even get into nursing university. I wouldn’t want nurses who aren’t vaccinated working with me.  I am a Canadian Nurse and you if you aren’t willing to protect yourself, you can’t protect others.
0	No, the government should not force individuals to take something that doesn’t have research on the long-term side effects. If they want to take that risk then let them.
1	My wife was one of them as a healthcare worker. She said it didn’t hurt at all and she still feels fine.
1	i find it hilarious how people who have no education on virology try to weigh in on why they go against doctors. its like asking for the advice of a child rather than a calculus professor when having a math question.
0	No !!! We do not need to continue to take boosters and perpetuate this insanity.
0	If only covid vaccines works on preventing infection then I wouldn't be here in this subreddit. Lockdown again
0	Won't touch this unless I 100% couldn't get over it.. they are acting like the side affects are nothing lol
1	I'm from Canada and because of the vaccine shortage we just have to take what we are given and be happy and I think most of us are but it's nice to know that all brands are effective. Can't wait until I'm eligible!
1	I am a doctor and let me say a thing, THE VACCINES ARE SECURE!
0	You can’t. Remember, normal vaccines take 5 - 10 years to develop. These were fast-tracked, bypassing many safety trials. We are the guinea pigs!
1	Yes, please get vaccinated. There is no evidence of any kind of long-term side effects, and while this particular vaccine is new, this type of vaccine is well-researched. Note that a lot of people do have some immediate effects, like a sore arm for a day or two, or even flu-like symptoms for a day, so plan for that.
1	my whole family got it and i didn’t. i go to in person school and work almost everyday. so glad i got vaccinated lol
0	These #Covid_19 vaccines are a huge failure for industrial research Covid-19: 52% of the world's population vaccinated. The death curve has the same slope. Polio: eradicated with 88% of the world's population vaccinated. At 52% coverage, the decline was very clear.
0	no because Norwegian officials said 23 people had died in the country a short time after receiving their first dose of the vaccine.
0	?For the first time in history the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who haven?t taken it.? ? Kevin Sorbo
0	TO THE ATTENTION OF THE VIDEO CREATOR GET READY FOR NUREMBERG TRIALS FOR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY THERE IS NOW ENOUGH EVIDENCE THAT THESE POISON INJECTIONS ARE VERY DANGEROUS & MANY WILL STAND TRIAL
0	I hope we do that in the Philippines too. Here they don't let us go inside the malls, they don't let us use public transportation, can't get a job without vaccination, they don't let us go out even though we don't have symptoms. They are really looking for ways for us to choose to be vaccinated.
0	How everyone are still lining up for their shots is beyond belief.
0	idk gov forces me to vaccine but i dont want to because i dont trust it
0	the vaccine in 100% experamental we know nothing of what will happen.
0	It isn’t about health, it’s about compliance. It’s about confusion and division.  It’s about pharmaceutical profits.
0	If they are that safe the these companies should have zero problems with taking all responsibility with them! Right now they get a free pass! Also we still have little data on long term side effects down the road!
1	The staff which is unvaccinated mistakenly believes they know enough to refuse it.
0	What parents need to know?! That the vaccine is a big f’n joke. Let’s Go Brandon
1	Exactly. These are the consequences that make it so depressing to watch when we have protections people refuse to use.
0	You can still get COVID! The vaccine is useless
1	It's one small step for us but a giant leap for Nigeria and the world. Get vaccinated today. Let's keep the game on.
0	Dislike the people are waking up we are done being Guinea pigs!
1	I got Pfeizer in March.  Every physician I know took it and that’s good enough for me.
1	This vaccine is life!! YOu have to get this shot for you and for the others
1	Anybody ever heard of omicron before we heard omicron? Nobody said the vax would stop the spread of covid, but it slows it down and reduces hospitalization and deaths. Israel is now using a 4th dose to try to stop their daily average death toll going from 0 in December to 38 now
1	Just got the vaccine! Only the first one. All I felt was tiredness and soreness! But I feel great!
1	I take my responsibility as a human being on this planet by taking the shot!
0	Most if not all testing on vaccines are done in 3rd world countries and orphanages. However the covid vaccine hasn't had short or long term testing.
1	I am very glad I decided to get vaccinated
1	You definitely take a vaccine to protect yourself and others. If someone is vaccinated and they are less likely to become infected or develop symptoms, then they are less likely to spread the disease to others. That’s why vaccinations work.
1	Can’t wait to get it!!!!! Thank you to all those smart people in the world that made this possible!
0	Vaccines don't work ! AND THEY NEVER HAVE !!!!!!!
1	when i researched the different vaccines, i think the fizer is the best for sensitive body type... Just go with it...
0	These poor vaccine makers, barely making any profits. I feel so badly for them.
1	Vaccine efficacy rates are expected to be 50% or higher. This virus is mutating quicker than others.Just bc its not effective enough FOR YOU does not mean it's a bad vaccine"
0	Yep, I’m fully vaccinated (Pfizer) and boosted a month ago, tested positive 4 days ago.
1	I'm actually going to take the vaccine today
1	That's cute, but Amish ppl get covid too, in fact it's hitting them hard right now because they don't want to vax.
0	Proud to call myself an Anti-vaxxer.
0	The side effects are way worse than COVID if you're healthy so
0	I've never been vaccinated when I get sick its only for about 2 days most of my friends that have vaccinations get sick for weeks i think I'm good
1	First time in history that the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who haven't taken it.
0	I don't believe in vaccines, people who are vaccinated still get Covid
0	My friend works on icu and has seen first hand side effects from the vaccine. Probably a clue as to why she won’t go and get it!
0	I would’ve never gotten vaccinated if I had realized the extent to which vaccinated can carry and spread the virus. Without limiting infection, there’s no point for young healthy people who aren’t at risk to Covid (especially those with prior infection like me)
0	Getting COVID while unvaccinated = you are spawn of Satan and deserve a painful death. Getting COVID while vaccinated = oh thank God you got vaccinated and still got COVID; this is acceptable
1	So good news
1	I'm not Anti-Vax, vaccines do a lot of long-term good things for you.
1	Why wasn’t the Chinese vaccine offered. They uses the old technology…….the ones we use for the flu vaccines every year. It is safe . It is mild and safe.
1	That 'YES!' had the proper amount of spunk! I wish more people in the media weren't afraid of using the proper tone needed to convey the importance of vaccines.
1	Covid is not a hoax Stop the misinformation #GetVaccinated #maskup #ByeSpotify
0	Covidiots are the people who don’t understand that virus’s mutate for survival (as Darwin discovered) and that vaccines are actually encouraging that process.
1	Thank you for creating this vaccine.. they are saving so many lives im fully vaccinated and greatful
1	Quit caring about the unvax long ago. Do care about the stats and results however. Keep it going unvax fools.
0	Yet they continue to mandate this vaccine. I don't don't get it. I pray for those that got the vaccine and those that are about to, due to mandates .
1	I'd like our govts to focus on health care, health care staff supports and $, and a streamlined effort to keep covid under control.  This is likely to include vaccination at border crossings.
1	You can only throw out a life preserver so many times before you stop trying to save the drowning.  I am weary of the unvaccinated to the extent that I no longer care about their catching covid.
1	vaccines protect not only against disease but also against infection and transmission
1	Stop treating the unvaccinated when they become sick!
0	How come the media never censors or says misleading when it suits the governments narrative on these vaccines?
0	Don’ Get Vaccinated and Help Save The Earth…
1	Vaccine might be avaliable for kids under 5 by the end of this month. Get your kids vaccinated.
0	Unvaccinated from France here. Congrats to the fellow Australians I know how tough it is over there. Stay strong brothers.
0	I felt shit before vaccine I feel shit after vaccine. What's the difference, does it even matter? Been ill 20 years.
1	Everyone please take the vaccine.
0	I think staying home is effective against covid I'm healthy but praying for the ones that have this disease
0	Get your brick of the official world anti vax wall, and make history! Share with your friends...
0	My husband and I have not had the vaccine yet because we are worried about vaccine side effects.
1	This is Darwin at work, let him be, thinning the herd.
0	The reason why I’m not getting vaccine is because I’ve had family members get it and STILL get covid. Also it is literally a test to put on people. We are just experiment and I would rather not get something that I don’t know fully works which obviously it doesn’t.
0	No discrimination, no vaccine mandates
0	I was offered the vaccine and I decided to pass. Not much of a risk taker. Too many "UNKOWNS." I get what the Dr. is saying. However I feel anytime you choose speed and quantity you are risking quality. I am not an antivacer by any means. Just gonna go with a bit of common sense, logic, reasoning, and my own intuition. Thank you to all of those who have faith in the vaccine & the govenment that are willing to take one for the team. I need to see more cases and I want to give it time. So thank you for taking the risk...you are all true heroes.❤ The benefits do not outweigh the risks for me currently...and I don't care to be a hero. This is the best decision for me...not suggesting anyone do the same. So if you have something negative to say...save it. No one is going to change my mind and I really give ZERO shits about what others opinions have on how I live my life.
0	An inhumane practice being done worldwide.
1	Nope, that is you. I would not be offended. As a pro vaxxer, I am going to wait for a while.
0	If the vaccines work why do we still have to wear masks even after getting 3 doses? Wtf.
1	Some high risk people can't get the vaccine due to being allergic to the ingredients and things like that. So their "protection" comes from most other people not being able to spread it to them because they're vaccinated. That's what we mean by herd immunity. High risk people who can't get the vaccine are protected by the immunity of the herd.
0	Vaccines are against God's plan.
0	Sometimes I feel like the vaccines are only about money
0	I have a question if I had COVID and got it a second time with milder symptoms that would mean I have immunity right ? The first time I really thought I was going to drown in my own lungs from mucus and I could not breathe eat or make it to the bathroom but I did manage as best as I could and I kept my finger on 911 (I was afraid to go to the hospital because if I had it I didn't want to give it - if not I didn't want it) I went to Ergentcare and stayed outside I got an inhaler and cough medicine w/cod. I have never had a cold or flu like that before .. it's no joke ! But I still have some immunity from this monster right ... ? My choice is to skip the shot .. !
1	The unvaccinated should’ve been left out of lot of things months ago. They’d get used to it by now
1	I’m getting vaccinated tomorrow
0	Fuck off system! Fuck off government
1	Get the vaccine don’t be scared
1	It is not due to the vaccination. Just trust your government and obey it's rules
1	The pandemic has shown us how devastating a disease can be without vaccines to control it. As COVID-19 vaccinations gather pace, they are a powerful reminder of what vaccines can do. This World Immunization Week, find out how #VaccinesWork.
1	Wait the vaccine is 100% safe and effective!
1	A vaccine does not only prevent severity. Ie there is no vaccine that does not effect cases but makes the cases less sick only. For example this would never happen.2 groups of 1000 people one getting vaccine and the other not. Both groups show 100 cases of the viral illness. IE no difference in prevention. But those 100 who got the vaccine are less sick. So cases aren't prevented only severity.No vaccine works this way. Vaccines prevent infection. Although we do look at hospitalization and death prevention sometimes because that's what we want to vaccine to prevent. However of it does prevent severity of world have to do so by preventing cases too.A vaccine does not circulate through the body like an antibiotic that treats the illness if you happen to catch it. That's not a thing.
1	I think if I'm not wrong vaccination is just for making our immunity better......But whatever the consequences we should necessarily take precautions. But whatever the consequences we should necessarily take precautions.
0	the literal CEO of Pfizer wasn’t thinking about money when deciding how much to invest in the vaccine development, really??
1	The next Nobel Prize in Medicine/Biology belongs to Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman. And to those who think the Covid vaccine was developed too fast: Try 1996 when they started developing the science that led to it. Is 25 years of research and development "too fast"?
1	I just got my first shot yesterday. I’m so happy I did, it’s really already helped with the stress of a pandemic
0	Some one told me cancers is one of the side effects
1	I feel so bad for women in the first interview, despite her not getting it, it’s sad seeing people be in a situation like that, everyone please get the vaccine!!
1	I like how you explained the anti vax community is mainly responsible for most of the misinformation out there. We didnt pay attention to them before COVID but all of a sudden they’ve managed to scare a lot of us into not getting vaccinated including myself. After this video my mind is clear and I’m getting vaccinated. Good luck to me!
0	SAME NOT VACCINATED AND NOT GONNA BE EVER
0	You just proved a point: no need for a vaccine when there are plenty of effective alternative therapies that prevent Covid from progressing, prevent hospitalization, & prevent death. The experimental injections do none of that. In fact, quite the opposite.
1	I got both Pfizer vaccines and I never had a single problem other than a sore arm the next day. This was about 3 months ago now. My entire family except my grandpa (who got moderna’s instead) got Pfizer and was perfectly fine.
0	What about the 99% pre vaccine COVID infections who didn't require hospitalization?. You're assuming because I have been vaccinated I avoided hospitalization. But since I'm not anywhere near the high risk or even medium risk that without the Jab I would have been?
0	I love the term "vaccine hesitancy"   It's not hesitancy. It's just a big fat HELL NO!
1	Moral of the story, kids, is this: GET FUCKING VACCINATED. #AusOpen
0	Please end all mandates to the army, federal, and Healthcare workers since you are not responsible for vaccine injuries.
1	Just tell me how many shots I need to take
0	Ya didn't even need the FIRST shot but those that took it are wheely uckfed now.
1	The best thing to do is to strengthen our body and immune system
1	It is truly amazing how fast the pharmaceutical industry can move when confronted with a global pandemic.
1	The vaccines are not quite as effective against new variants, but still effective enough to very strongly recommend and fight against  them.
0	Welcome to the world of EXPERIMENTAL vaccines....good luck suckers.
1	I feel like I've been hit by a truckSömnig #BoosterDose
1	This is what happens when you look for medical advice from a being that doesn't exist or a rando on social media, whilst ignoring 99.9% of the world's scientists and medical professionals.  I'm all out of sympathy for these people.
0	Thank you for giving me another reason NOT to get the experimental shot!!
1	I love how everyone is so fixated on the long term effects of the vaccine, when they don't even consider the long term effects of being infected with covid.
1	Yes, everyone should be free to make their own choices. But when it comes with risk to others, we have to draw a line. Every COVID Patient in the ICU or the hospital in general means one less bed for someone else. Meaning, because you made a choice to not get vaccinated, someone else with a condition out of their control potentially doesn’t get that bed and the care they need. Cancer patients who were meant to have their operations next week have to wait another couple of months. It’s not just about your health, it’s about everyone else’s health too. I don’t like being told what to do either, I don’t think anybody does. That doesn’t give me the right to endanger others.
0	Vaccination is a medical procedure that CAN go wrong, even if that happens very, very rarely.
0	Britain is finally seeing sense. Mandatory vaccines for NHS workers and care staff is being reviewed. I don’t think vaccines for all care staff will go ahead now.
1	Two Pfizer or Moderna vaccines HALVE the risk of getting 'long Covid' and DOUBLE the profits of Pfizer and Moderna, expert says
1	I swear the thought process that went into these vaccines was clever as hell. Like, who thinks of using our own body to make the key markers of a virus which it will use to identify said virus? That's the most ingenious piece of biomedical engineering idea I've ever heard of.
1	Anti vaxxers are like vegans they have to tell everyone
0	Must be great getting paid to get a vitamin shot live on TV!
0	I will never get covid vaccine until I die
0	Im scared as I have chronic fatigue syndrome and chronic anxiety that’s caused a lot of physical symptoms so these vaccines scare me I feel I had almost scare myself into getting sick
1	Many thanks for your excellent video, which has certainly reassured me! I'm in England and had my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine this morning. My only concern is that we've been told we'll have to wait up to 12 weeks to get our second dose. Do you think this might weaken the effectiveness of the vaccine? I've subscribed ??
0	Not a chance in Hell I'd have my child take this poison. They are out of their minds. I thank god daily that I have a wife that works in the medical field. I thank god she's on the front lines of seeing what that poison dart is doing to her patients.
1	The vaccine wasn't bad. My side effects included lack of motivation, the urge to wanna eat cheese bites, and to watch TV all day
0	My younger sister who is in her 40’s had blood clot debris in her blood, then had sizers after she got the Pfizer vaccine. She’s still having pulmonary hypertension symptoms & now is on a heart monitor for a month. I’m on blood thinner after a massive PE following a broken ankle surgery the 2nd PE in the last 13 yrs & was told not to get the vaccine then told that it was ok to get the vaccine. Same dr. I’m so scared to get it. Either way I feel like I’m dammed if I do & dammed if I don’t. I’m worried for my sister.
0	I was gonna get it until a close friend of mine got the first dose & almost died so I’m good that I dont vaccinated
1	I had my second shot of pfizer 3 weeks ago. I feel amazing.
0	But coronavirus? Its unlikely I would even have symptoms, and I consider everything I did this year in terms of lockdown enough of a personal sacrifice for the vulnerable population. I will not be the vaccine "to do my part."
1	I got my first dose yesterday. I'm so incredibly grateful to live in a time and place where this is possible. I recognize my privilege and I'm simultaneously saddened that others will have to wait so long for theirs. In my community, vast amounts of vaccines have been (and are being) dumped because so few people are willing to take the risk of a new vaccine. If I didn't take the vaccine, it likely would have been a wasted dose, which
1	What about the possible long-term side effects of not getting vaccinated? DEATH!!
0	A friend here in France collapsed a few minutes after getting covid vaccine. She had to be hospitalized for several days
0	No! I will pass
1	I'm so excited to get my second COVID shot in 5 days
0	You are NOT talking about the so called covid vaccine right? Because it is not a vaccine
0	It is harassment to keep asking me once I have declined. Harassment is what criminals do.
1	How are medical staff oyt here convincing people not to get vaccinated??
0	Imagine putting your trust in this shit show of a vaccine, many weak minds on this planet
0	Who told you the VAX was safe? The same idiot who started PROJECT WARPSPEED ? We literally went from don’t trust the orange man, to hurry up and vax, don’t ask questions. UN real :/
0	if the vaccine was working how come people who are full vaccinated getting the virus it is suppose to work when will they stop lying to people .
0	Its different this time. I'm with the antivaxxers!!!
0	A little late, now that BILLIONS have taken it. We are lead by idiots.
0	It is true that vaccine gives ADHD
1	Let’s go Darwin
0	Your body does this naturally, no jab required.
0	I do not object to taking a vaccine that is proven effective. I just do not want to be the test subject that is being used for that proof. Vaccines take years to validate and test so how safe and proved will this be if done in a year or less?
1	None of us had sideffects besides sore arms and we have been protected from COVID. No regrets.
1	All approved COVID-19 vaccines have been thoroughly tested, and all provide a high degree of protection against getting seriously ill and dying from the disease.
1	This talk with the risks of vaccinating is so tiring. Just do it and improve your lives and ours for once!
1	If they are not vaccinated by now….consider them lost.
0	I took the John and Janssen vaccine and feels like you're taking LSD now I'm not saying this is for all the vaccine but I kind of have Psychedelics trip for instance
1	Thanks to all those who are intent on winning the Darwin Award. I'll take the vaccine.
0	I have seen people talking about how healthcare has stopped vaccination and a alien race is ready to replace us cause we're getting vaccinated
1	And so I expect that by this autumn we'll have lots of 'trial by fire' situations with vaccines in the world.
0	My girl friend got all 3 shots... still got covid... so now what?
0	I’m not sure this makes sense. How could you possibly know that your body has a better immune response with a vaccine vs natural antibodies? Is there any other examples of something where a vaccine outperforms natural antibodies?
1	Seeing events like this provokes fascists thoughts in my very liberal mind. A friend jokingly said we need a Duarte. The president of the Philippines is a HORRIBLE person but anyone caught without a mask is arrested and detained in a stadium. Wouldn't it be cheaper to offer anti vaxxers/maskers a reservation of sorts? Someplace pleasant, with all the organic or junk food they wanted. Even though our tax dollars would have to pay for it, I imagine it would be cheaper than the huge medical bills we're paying.
0	"Despite high vaccination rates", and people blame the unvaccinated, "and" the blamers just refused to wear masks. What a wonderful world we are in.
1	I’m as Pro-Vax as one can be.
0	Should of asked him what’s going on at the Pfizer building in Paris.
1	luckily I got the shot! Pls dont underestimate the importance of the vaccines
1	I am fully vaccinated and the peace of mind I feel is the opposite of the helplessness I felt for so long. Living with a fully vaccinated person as well. I'm very grateful.
0	we dont need vaccines.  we know treating covid early on will save 99.9% of all people
1	Many of those later deaths won’t be dead had they been vaccinated.
0	Why would you put an untested and unproven substance into your baby and risk not only your own health but that of your unborn child
1	Getting covid vaccines is actually less risky than other more traditional vaccines.
0	The media and press have all officially become one huge vaccination commercial.
0	India is pushing natural immunity and winning
1	Get on a list, get on a line, get jabbed!!!
0	Is this a joke?? Biden and countless other said ... take THIS vaccine and you won't get COVID. And all they can say now is "oops." They say - the science changed. No it didn't. There WAS no "science" ... only opinions. I honestly can't envision people trusting another vaccine to do what the first didn'tz
1	Yes we all know that Lisa but it does stop us from getting seriously ill and needing hospitalised it’s not going away anytime soon this Covid but through vaccines we can control how sever we take it, it like the annual flu jab you can still catch flu but on a lesser severity, I’ve had my first jab 3 months ago and my 2nd one is on Monday the 3rd of May and I can’t wait to be fulling vaccinated and get my life back to some sort of normal it’s the non vaccinated ones that’s keeping the pandemic going.
1	As a doctor myself, I have had an extreme reaction to a vaccine (anaphylaxis). But I have also have seen children with diseases that could have been prevented with a vaccine. Because of that, I make sure I do my due diligence, but my children are 100% vaccinated. Also because I have seen children with preventable diseases I will always make sure my patients have all information at their disposal before they make their choice.
1	Anti-vax people don't remind me of much other than that a ton of people can be convinced of anything with no credibility behind what they believe.
1	If anything has convinced me there's a mental health crisis in the US, it's the antivaxxer comments I find  on videos like this.
0	MY BODY MY CHOICE DUDE
1	Getting my booster today #boosted #BoosterDose me luck... Let's hope it doesn't kick my ass
1	Yes thank you for this vaccine, I know it will stop coronavirus indefinitely just like the other ones for sure.
0	Remember when they said do your bit and get the vaccine to protect others, meanwhile in the real world the vaccine takers were spreading it like wild fire.
0	I decline SARS-CoV-2 vaccination because I do not think that it is necessary for me. As a rule, I do not take unnecessary medications, because they are more likely to compromize health than to improve it.
0	Concerned about the side effects of the #PfizerBioNTech #COVID19 vaccine
0	Your body, your choice. But stop gaslighting those who understand that poison is NOT a cure for poison. Their body, their choice. They are anti vaxxers for the same reason people don't pet angry rattlesnakes.
1	if you don't have the vaccine, you're robbing someone else their right to live a healthy normal life
0	If it was about health, they would have mandated exercise and dieting years ago.
0	Yes people have had serious side effects from the COVID vaccines and yes people have died from the COVID vaccines. No the COVID vaccines don't stop the Corona virus from happening. There are more negatives than positives with the COVID vaccines.
1	When I got boosted I felt violently ill for three days... missed my students' big testing day... experiencing long lasting symptoms such as aches and pains but I wouldn't change it for the world
0	I’ve had my vaccines but governments mandating vaccines makes me suspicious and nervous
1	I love the part where daughter defies her parents to get vaccinated. She’s taking her health serious; non like her folks. They’re prob out of shape and don’t take their health too serious. Great job girl.
0	Nah fam this was rushed lmao vaccines take years to produce due to trial and error
0	Why do the protected need to be protected from the unprotected with a protection that didn't protect the protected.
1	I had Johnson one and booster no side effect feel great
1	Got my #BoosterDose today, #KakampinkWednesday! Pfizer woman since day one.
1	I am glad I got my vaccination
1	did my duty and received my first covid vaccine today
1	The more people who receive the coronavirus vaccines, the sooner vulnerable people can feel safe among others.
0	Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Him. There is no other intermediary. May Jesus Bless you, trust Him, give your life - and He will take care of it. Christ's Coming Is Near. Don't wait, come back while you still have time
0	I hear of all the side-effects people experience from covid and I'm turned off by a potential reduced chance of getting sick compared to a more likely chance of me getting side-effects from vaccines.
0	Why not? People took a “vaccine” for Covid without substantial evidence that it works, based solely on the recommendation of their medically unqualified local politicians.
1	They aren't a danger to me. They are a danger to my kids, who cannot get vaccinated yet.
1	My friend's sister died of Covid yesterday. Her funeral is today. This really brings it home to me. Whichever scientists can succeed in destroying Covid and giving us back human life - not the lives lost, but the lives still living - those scientists are indeed heroes.
1	First walk today since testing covid negative on Wednesday. Got through it ok just took a bit longer. I have noticed that even tho I am negative there are some lingering symptoms. Please get vaccinated. I don't know how I would have coped without being dble vaxed.
1	Thanks for sharing.....Vaccines can save many lives.......
0	You can call it whatever you want. I'm done. Life as normal. I don't care anymore. Or trust any of you. 1800+ views and 9 likes. That says something. Bet the dislike counter would be in the hundreds if they didn't remove it. Most people are over it.
1	Just got the vaccine! Only the first one. All I felt was tiredness and soreness! But I feel great!
1	The vaccines reduce the chance of infection which reduces the chance of long Covid. The vaccines shorten the viral load, etc., for breakthrough infections, thereby reducing the risk of long Covid for others. Shots + masks = safest solution
0	It’s time to stop spreading misinformation and calling vaccination side effects rare. It’s now common
0	"Vaccine Macht Frei" We should crowd-fund to get a big metal gate made up for the hospital with their new slogan on it.
0	Finally a truthful Dr!!! I’ve been saying this to family, friends, and coworkers…. I’m almost 50 and never had a flu shot!!! Drunk driver deaths are higher than flu deaths but I don’t see alcohol or cars being discontinued!!
1	It's really nice of them to do this the vaccine is free of charge
1	Thank you, to these people who are @ the front of the line for us, but please get vaccinated, it is so important. keep safe everyone
1	What I got out of this was we should vaccinate not just the wealthiest nations to stop the pandemic.  This sounds extremely intelligent and like a good plan
1	Vaccine. Passports. Now.
0	We need to get over this flu, no vaccines needed!
0	I find it disturbing the "vaccine" ads are the only pharmaceutical ads in U.S. history with *no* side effects warnings. That tells you everything you need to know about how "honest" they are.
0	Now there is talk of the new Flurona mutant, flu and Covid have merged apparently, they will be pushing even more vaccines..... You just can't make it up, and what a day to be announcing it.... Happy New Year for Big Pharma....
0	my cousin and uncle are both vaccinated, 2 times, yet they still caught covid 2-3 months after they took the 2nd shot to me, the vaccine seems useless unless you have other health issues. if you're healthy you got nothing to worry about based on the stats, surviving chance is 98.1%
0	Yes vaccination is not safe if we don’t do anything about it- it will go on and on
1	Celebration of hope with vaccines
0	First and second shots don’t work! Pushing the boosters is comical, especially for teens. You have lost all credibility!
0	Vaccine is virus
1	We are vaccinated and boosted. We shielded totally before vaccines due to clinically extremely vulnerable, but not now, and we have never caught it. Due in part to being reasonably careful, but there have been Covid has killed millions of people. The vaccine is safe and effective. My kiddo is fully vaccinated and doing greatexposures, and the vaccines have protected us I feel.
1	These vaccines are entirely safe and hey are effective, your family doctor will assure you of that .
1	Evidence from the first study of long covid in children suggests that more than half of children aged between 6 and 16 years old who contract the virus have at least one symptom lasting more than 120 days, with 42.6 per cent impaired by these symptoms during daily activities
1	I'm planning getting the shot still and will keep wearing my mask till this covid-19 is over
1	Mine is Pfizer im fully vacinated now.. yesterday is my second dose so far no side effects to me
1	Just to be clear up front I am not a anti-vax person. Me and the wife are both vaccinated and my kids are up to date on their vaccines l. I am kind of curious about this omacron thing and want to understand it better. Isn't the media saying that it's not that bad and on par with a common cold. If that's the case why would we do anything to prevent it? Why would we need immune protection to it? Doesn't getting the actual sickened give you a more robust immune response to subsequent covid infections?
1	Really timely video and explanation of some extremely important questions that need to be publicized to enhance Covid-19 vaccine acceptance.
1	And suddenly the anti-Vaxxers become YouTube educated experts again
1	I cant wait to get a shot.
0	Mass deception. Covid isn't real. The rigged testing system is real. Vaccine damage is very real. And those damaged are testing positive on the rigged testing system. A giant scam to get you into a biosecurity totalitarian system. RT
1	This is an excellant piece & factual  report that hints that its a now a pandemic of the UN vaccinated !!!!
1	I lost a love one to covid so get vaccinated before you regret it
0	I will NEVER get this shot.
1	she claims that two of her grandchildren were injured after getting vaccines It's really easy to claim that a kid was injured by vaccines if a kid gets sick a month after the vaccination.
0	Unfortunate. As those of you who have been vaccinated you're shedding and being tracked. Also, according to Pfizers own document those who are unvaccinated should stay away from those who are vaccinated(trial study patients). It's a 146 page document you will find what you're looking for on pages 65-69. Stay fearless and brave out here.
1	Imagine being a doctor or a nurse fighting so hard to keep someone alive only to be told you're lying and I haven't got covid.
0	Thank you for giving me another reason NOT to get the experimental shot!
1	I am not an anti-vaxxer I believe that the vaccines work, but to push out the covid vaccine so early without really long-term testing makes me a bit nervous, i don't really know how it works, so i may get things wrong, but I think if they had a longer period to test it would make the public less angry, also take a weight of most people's chest
1	Wake up! take the vaccine is the only weapon to slow down this virus
1	It’s pretty darned clear: if you’re vaxxed your odds are so much stronger. So really, unless you’re not old enough to be vaxxed or have some really compelling medical complication, get vaxxed to protect YOURSELF and EVERYONE else.
1	My aunt in Indonesia contracted covid after going to Bali for a short holiday. She slowly suffered and shared photo of herself looking scared and helpless, sent us voice texts sounding breathless and suffocating. All the while exchanging prayers or words of encourage in the family group chat. Please the virus is real, even if you are strong and healthy, others may not be and will suffer from this virus. Thank God she recovered but she still got herself vaccinated for added protection.
0	Imagine a vaccine so safe that you have to be threatened to take it, For a disease so deadly that you have to get tested to know if you have it.
1	my teacher once was explaining to us that vaccines are safe. she said that her friend was anti vaxxer and didn't want to vaccinate her child. one day her child had a very extreme fever and and because of that his legs got paralysed and now they are undeveloped. the fever was caused by a bacteria or a virus that vaccines could protect him from. if he was vaccinated maybe he would have a normal life now…
1	I got my Pfizer vaccine yesterday and the only thing I have is sore arm and tiredness. Also I slept for 11 hours and still feel tired. No fever so I'm happy.
1	Go get vaccinated soon, never trust the rumours.
0	vaccine is not safe
1	These scientists should receive a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their tireless work. So impressive and selfless!! Ain't "magic"...SCIENCE RULES!!!!!!!
0	I know a guy that's strong as an ox and got his 3rd and right after he was being rushed to the hospital in ambulance and a two day stay for heart attack symptoms.
0	Parents and kids protecting themselves from the vaxx approve
1	The initial two doses will prevent hospitalisation and death
0	There are no benefits just more money for big pharma
1	Mama jusk killed a men, She forgot to wash her hand, Made a sandwich now he died, Mama he was so young, But you didn't vaccinate him, Mama don't be anti vaccine , If you don't want to see him in coffin,
0	Fantastic to see people standing together for freedom of choice our democratic right.
0	Then dont go outside? Lockdown can be enforced on an individual level. Surely a small price to pay to ensure the safety of your kids upto your own standards.
1	Me and my parents were a little skeptical at first but all it took was some research to find out it was safe. As long as you get your info from actual sources and not facebook you should be fine! 👍
1	My nine year old had no issues with the vaccine. I'm thankful for his chance to make antibodies without the organ damage the virus causes
0	Soon so many variants and vaccines and then we will have to wear 5 layered masks. When does the madness end. Please stop the madness.
0	One more on the market. Gotta grease the palms of the pharmaceuticals while the market is ripe. One after another, and the last one is never enough. Anyone who takes this has to be as deranged as the current pres and vp. You've lost the plot
1	We don't know the long term effects of anything, even the hot cheetos you probably eat or basically anything you take or eat at the store. I understand your concerns but at least apply this to everything you put in your body.
0	Oh, it works. But not for the intention of covid. Global genocide comes to mind..heart attacks, strokes, and blood clots are what these things produce..been hearing testimonies from funeral homes and what they are pulling out of the dead. We are in war.
0	I haven t taken a shot yet. Why wouldn t I wait for the next vaccine?
1	Remember, the #COVIDVaccine is not a Cure, it is not a magic wand and it does not just make Covid dissaper just like that. It's very important for us all to get the vaccine but at the same time stay very vigilant.
1	Even if the vaccine just partially stops the spread, it's still great news
1	Got my second one yesterday and I literally just woke up because I’m freezing
0	I appreciate some of these comments about this video makes me feel like I'm not alone my family and I have been living like hermits and masking of course but because we are unsure of the vaccine we have had friends and family members who are just rude almost hateful towards our decision I was always taught that just because you don't get a agree doesn't mean you can't get along.
0	Tell this to ppl family's that passed away from getting vaccinated you can see it your self at VAERS
0	The problem for me, is not so much which vaccine, but as I had the #Pizer first dose, will I be forced to have a different brand for the second dose, or go without, because the Pfizer #CovidVaccine is no longer available in UK?
0	If you have to be persuaded, and reminded, and pressured, and lied to, and incentivized, and coerced and bullied, and socially shamed, and guilt-tripped, and threatened, and punished, and criminalized...if all of this is considered necessary to gain your compliance...you can be absolutely certain that what is being promoted is not in your best interest.
0	Oh man she's so annoying... it is not true that hospitalized people a mostly unvaccinated... FAKE
1	Omicron meet Portugal, one of the world’s most vaccinated nations. Portugal has vaccinated ~90% of its total population.  Don’t tell me vaccines don’t work
1	Thanks to the millions of Canadians Flag of Canada who chose #CovidVaccine.
0	I DO NOT NEED vaccine
0	Why they pushing a vaccine that clearly doesn’t work? Wake people. Time to take our freedom back
0	It freaks me out that the vaccine will be distributed based on skin color and not based on health and age.
0	What concerns me is that safety tests can only test for known problems, unknown problems are only revealed by time.
1	The unvaccinated do not understand simple arithmetic. They do not understand simple logic. They do not possess common sense. They are, however, very gullible, especially when someone is telling them that someone else is responsible for the problems they cause for themselves.
1	What evidence do you have to support that the vaccines are unsafe?  Each vaccine has minor side effects and a couple have adverse reactions.  This is a very small number.  Covid-19 has killed millions and its mutations are killing more, every day.  Which do you choose? A strong chance of no Covid thanks to a vaccine or Russian roulette with Covid-19
0	I am confident that is their plan! They want to drastically reduce world population and control those who survive with implanted bullshit in their vaccines!
1	I’m getting the shot... But please stop saying “trust me on this”. It reminds me (and others I’m sure) of Donald Trump, and everytime he says that, I know it’s probably wrong.
0	Another day another dislike, still happily unvaccinated ^_^
0	After 2 Doses vaccinated people test positive again. Not helpful.
1	I got vaccinated yesterday today in the morning I felt pain in my left arm including headache and little bit dizzy
1	People should do what they want.....as long as they sign a waiver not to take up a hospital bed, staff, medicine or medical facilities if they get it. They want to be on their own in this world.....let them be ON THEIR OWN.
1	This is amazing, thanks to all scientists and medical workers. Now what we need to do is convincing people that it is safe. That shouldn't be so hard, right?
1	Vaccine is the greatest innovation of all time
0	When searching for truth, always follow the money trail. Natural immunity has no profit margin, therefore, will be ignored in favor of vaccines that do not prevent reinfection and is still infectious to others. More importantly, enormous profits from vaccine sales for the "illness profit centers" and big pharma, is always the motive.
0	Hey Mr. Pfizer CEO?? if the vaccines are so safe, why is your company immune from liability?
1	Anyone still refusing is definitely someone the military will be better off without. Good news
1	I refused the vaccine due to potential health risks, however i've changed my mind after *actually* trying to understand the comparative risks of covid. So i admit to getting that wrong - partly out of anxiety, primarily out of laziness. I had my first vaccination last week.
0	the majority of people I see come in the hospital with covid received the vaccine. It doesn't help whatsoever. You can still catch it, spread it and end up in the hospital. Not sure what this vaccine is or does but it's not for covid.
1	I’m a Respiratory Therapist who works in south eastern Virginia. This past week we’ve seen triple the amount of SEVERE Covid cases than at the worst from the first wave last year.Something is definitely different. And YES, we’ve seen a young patient as well.If this is any indication of what’s to come, we will run out of room and staff. Not to sound all gloom and doom but yes, people are believing the myths unfortunately. Several patients who have lost their lives in the past week have wished they would have been vaccinated. It has been a sad week indeed. When people started being vaccinated our Covid numbers dropped to almost nil. Medical science at it’s best! I dont know about strains and what the difference is but people need to heed the warnings. Vaccines work.
0	Natural immunity is better. Convince me otherwise…
1	LeBron is a phenomenal human for his help and his help getting ppl to vote I so wish he would campaign to get blacks vaxxed as they are scared.He got the shot and said it's a personal.choice, which is incorrect, bc unvaxxed are killing ppl@KingJames https://t.co/Tpr13j1iiT
1	If enough people are vaccinated, we can prevent 100,000 deaths or more.
0	If you get the experimental jab in the arm you are trusting the wrong people!
0	Students are being mandated to take the vaccines + booster, injured but without a voice; we've enough of this craziness.
1	Vaccines have been the success story of 2021. Seeing less serious cases in the vaccinated. Hospitals still have the unvaccinated being admitted in greater numbers to the covid wards.
0	Three months out from second Pfizer and still dealing with shortness of breath, fatigue, brain fog, heavy limbs, nausea.... side effects are real.... and no fun! I regret to have taken the shot
1	Any smart employer that cares for its employees will require vaccinations
1	Covid-19 vaccines in England are estimated to have directly prevented between 91,700 and 98,700 deaths
1	Nope, the vaccine doesn't stop cases, it just greatly lowers the rate of death if you do get it. Dumb, next.
0	Bahhh I smell sheep ??
1	How sad. For now the jabbed ones will be the victims of the non jabbed. We, the jabbed, will suffer the consequences of the non jabbed ones…
1	If everybody will just go and get the vaccine and the booster shot every year we can make sure Covid will always be around like the flu.
1	I got both doses last year. For the first shot, my arm was just sore for a day. The second dose was a little bit unpleasant. Had a slight fever and runny nose for a day, but after that I was alright again. Till now I haven’t gotten sick, so that’s good! Stay safe everyone!
1	Good. More countries need to follow the lead of the US and come down hard on the unvaccinated.
1	Just go get the Pfizer or Moderna shot
0	Here's a fun search for Google How many people have died from covid virus vaccine world wide" You can't get a answer 😭
1	Myself and my kiddos have been fully vaccinated and so far have yet to catch covid or any varints. Thank you God!
1	It’s amazing, and should be something we are all excited about. A HUGE advancement in the medical field and will change the future of vaccines. It’s a shame partisanship and drama is putting a damper on that.
1	vaccine is saving everyone. You need to start being honest with yourself. You are vaccinated. That’s why you don’t get whooping cough and tetanus.
1	Neil Young the 76-year-old rock-and-roll icon has taken a stand against vaccine misinformation, telling the streaming platform Spotify to remove his music if it continues to feature those who regularly disseminate lies and conspiracy theories about Covid-19. Well Done
1	now i have seen it all. elderly patient had to move in with son b/c daughter told her she would end the relationship if she got the covid vaccine. She is now admitted with COVID pneumonia. Unvaccinated.
0	Remember their faces. Remember their names. They will face justice.
1	everyone live off grid while you can and connect with nature
1	I JUST GOT VAXXED YALL
1	Honestly antivaxers not only endanger themselves but also the others as well with their stupidity…
0	Thank you for the update on Covid-19 Vaccine. I am one who will be afraid to take an early vaccine like this. Be careful out there
0	But, but it’s safe!
0	Safe and effective with all of the damage that it has done, not to mention the deaths, wow I don't believe it!!!
1	Had my Covid-19 Vaccination, doing my bit helping to save the human race.
1	The DM comments are full of anti vaxxer garbage, such as from users like MozManc.
1	I once dreamt that i have worms for fingers  Now I'm anti sleep WAKE UP!!! (pun intended)
0	I will never ever take that shot
1	As long as it is free for everyone, and NOT just the people you deem as "needy". We all need this vaccine to be free, if the virus is even as remotely as dangerous as claimed.
0	And even merrier, China wouldn't be slow at mass manufacturing it for the world. Great news!
1	Please get vaccinated and stop posting information that makes other people hesitant.  People are dying and we don't all have the resources you do when things go bad.
1	GOT MY VACCINE CALL TODAY!!! Get on waiting lists, people.
1	THE COVID19 VACCINE IS IMPORTANT FOR ANY BODY.
1	You vile anti-vax lowlifes are responsible for the deaths of probably thousands of gullible people. How you sleep at night is beyond me. Shame on you all.
0	Honestly, you can’t. Why? Because of who makes them - pharmaceutical companies. Ever watch ads on tv for new drugs? The list of side effects is longer than your arm and much worse than what the drug is supposed to be curing in the first place! It is in their best interest to keep us all sick for as long as possible. It’s how they make their money. If you think I’m lying or paranoid or just crazy, do a little research of your own. There are a few links below to help you get started. Pharmaceutical companies have been injuring people for decades. They’ve paid billions in damages and keep putting the same harmful drugs on the market (with the FDA’s approval) year after year after year. Do you ever wonder why there are so many diabetic drugs available? 90% of the time diabetes can be completely controlled and even cured with a proper diet. But there’s no money in that! Obviously it’s better to take costly injections on a daily basis along with buying meters and lancets and test strips than to eat right! 🤦♀️ Doctors used to use a lot of natural remedies and they worked. But since drug makers have figured out how much money is at stake, doctors are no longer taught what natural remedies even are. A very large chunk of their education is sponsored by drug companies. They teach doctors how to write prescriptions for drugs that will make them (pharmaceutical companies) boat loads of money. Every doctor knows that losing weight and changing your diet can have a tremendous impact on many common diseases: diabetes, heart disease, allergies, etc., but instead of advising you regarding diet, they would rather write a prescription. And if you think doctors don’t get kick backs and incentives to push certain drugs, you’re naive. Because they do! How many commercials have you seen from attorneys with a phone number like 1–800-BAD-DRUG? I’m in the US and can’t hardly watch 5 minutes of tv without seeing at least one commercial for a class action suit because of drugs that harm people. Look at Montesano, the manufacturer of Round Up. They’ve known for decades that their weed killer causes cancer but they keep using it - on crops that grow our foods! No one has slapped their hands and said they can’t do that. Johnson & Johnson used asbestos in their baby powder for decades, knowing full well it causes cancer. Now they’re making one of the vaccines? No thanks, I’ll pass. If you truly want the truth, it’s out there. Do your own research. Listen to all sides and make up your own mind.
0	VACCINATION is an EXTERMINATION program hiding behind the illusion of public health...
1	The vaccine working fine as they intended, so no need to be worried
1	Moderna vaccine recipient thank you for all of your efforts and Pfizer too. You have saved the world.
0	He got his vaccine so he can still wear his mask and stay 6 feet away from his friends at school
1	it's sad that ppl actually think that vaccines r harmful
0	No vaccine. I'm afraid. Instead if everyone around me has had the vaccine they will all be immune, which means I cannot catch the lurgy from them so I won't need to have the vaccine myself
0	Great that these people took the time to do this .this vaccine is not a real vacicne
0	I rather catch a bullet then the jab
1	My son is 6 and I was initially nervous about vaccinating him, but I ended up doing it due to reading some epidemiologists’ papers on the trials. I was deeply anxious after each shot, but felt like this was the right choice for him personally and for the community.
0	Just like the last wonder vaccines that do nothing.
1	Emotions and stories aside, vaccines are overwhelmingly beneficial. Reactions do occur, but research should go into them to see why they occur, and how to make tailor-made vaccines for them. The benefits outweigh the risks.
0	Might skip boosters 4-8 and just get the 9th one.
1	There is overwhelming scientific evidence that the vaccines being offered in the United States (moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson) are completely safe
0	Hopefully these vaccines won't be mandatory
1	Kinda ironic how anti vaxxers may have already gotten vaccinated as a child.
1	I don’t want him to die. I’m angry with him. I appreciate that he has stated how important it is to get vaccinated. I hope he gets well. I just get so tired of hearing that people are dying because they are against the vaccine. What you are supposed to do is get vaccinated and wear a mask and use hand sanitizer. Your babies need you mama. Get well and go home.
1	Thank you for making this and educating the people.
0	They uses the old technology…….the ones we use for the flu vaccines every year.
0	I'll take the covid instead thanks.
0	I would like to see a study to find out if there are any correlations between the vaccinated and the hiv positive for possibly being the source for all these variants #vaccine
0	You’re not in hospital. It is by definition mild.
1	Covid patients are still in the hospitals.... 88 in NCH today. Vaccines help prevent severe infections.
1	Finally, good news
0	I’m still not getting vaccinated.
1	I' ve got my 1st shot of Moderna Vaccine.
1	Science !! I’m ready for this vaccine.
0	What kind of idiot take a shot that clearly still in it’s experimental stage that has countless reports of adverse effects and calls the people wanting to wait for more data idiots?  Idiot is the person who willingly replaces his common sense with fear.  We have about one year of data on the covid vaccine whereas we have about 90 years of data on the flu vaccine. Do not compare them. They’re not the same. One is proven safe. One is not.
1	One of many. Some are already past this point. Regardless, it's unlikely any vaccine will be widely available this year.
1	The vaccines are actually saving countless lives.
0	I'll take my chances and not getting the jab. Thanks for your concern
1	I would take the Covid vaccine for free!  In fact, I would PAY to take it!  Covid 19 could kill me if I catch it. The strong motivation to take it, and even have to pay to take it, is already there.
1	Triple vaccinated and so grateful to be! I did it for myself, family and friends. I did it to hopefully not contribute to overburdening our healthcare workers who are overwhelmed.
0	The biggest question is, why are you trying to force something on me I don't want?
0	I'm starting to think I should've held out a little longer before getting fully vaxxed.
1	We agreed that the vaccine is safe first and effective
0	It has nothing to do with a v'1rus and everything to do with control and greed.
0	Don't believe the hype. Don't take a jab.Over.
0	Vaccines are killing people. They will give you blood clots. They will fuck up your immune system. They are not designed to help you. They are designed to kill a portion of the population. This is worse than the Holocaust.
0	Look at third world countries that are doing much better with omicron despite their very low vaccination rate; natural immunity is more effective than vaccination.
1	pro-vaxxers won't have to worry about dying
0	If it was such a gtreat idea, then why are they wanting to force everyone to do it? Usually if something is good and great people will do it without force.
0	If the vaccination is mandate in schools, my kids will be home schooled
0	Nope. so far there is negative FX to those that have already taken it & a few have perished. Of course some have to kick the bucket for the system to work, but that's not how I'm going out.
1	Get the shot so we don’t overwhelm the hospitals
0	Bla bla bla now its over with earn millions from fake vaccin and covid tests, show your Swizz account.
1	A little over a year ago, I got my first Covid Vaccine, so far triple jabbed
0	Wow, I'm impressed about his confidence regarding the medium/long-term efficacy of the vaccine. Can you tell me how many doses are needed to maintain medium/long-term protection? 1 dose? 2 doses? 3 doses? 4 doses? 5 doses?...
1	Glad I just got my booster! Glad everyone in my family and at worked bullied me into it too! Now here I am with three shots I didn’t want to get… covid positive!!! Thank you all for the help
1	I think that's the failure of US education system whereby individualism is more important than collective well-being. I do respect that everyone should have a choice, and many people in other countries are choosing to protect the community by vaccinating.
0	The ONLY person who will decide what goes into my body is ME!
1	Don't be a little prick, get a little prick. Help end the pandemic
0	I'm not against vacine but I'm not getting the vacine at this time.
1	I took it im fine y'all
0	Since the vaccine doesn't stop you from getting Covid and doesn't stop you from transmission why do they force people to take it?
1	Everybody, go get your shot
1	Get your shot, help yourself and the others!
0	I’d rather suffer from covid than get GBS. People survive covid every day, but being paralyzed for life is terrible.
0	THIS IS ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. VACCINES USE LABARATORY ABORTED BABY FETAL MEAT TO CREATE A GENETICALLY MODIFIED MRNA TO INJECT IN EVERYBODY WHO BELIEVES THIS SICK LIE. THE VIRUS WAS CREATED IN A LAB IN WUHAN LABAROTORY INI 2009, WHERE PFIZER BUILT A LAB IN 2009 NEXT TO THE WUHAN LABAROTORY. PFIZER BUILDS FACITILY IN WUHON CHINA IN 2009 BEFORE COVID HIT http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/pfizer_to_build_r_and_d_facility_in_wuhan,_china_984211 THEY ARE USING SACRIFICIAL REMNANTS OF BABY FETAL MEAT!

We need to focus on saving lives right now. We need to care for our neighbors. The Vatican and bishops agree. The Vatican has issued clear guidance that permits Roman Catholics in good faith to receive COVID-19 vaccines that use fetal cell lines in development or production" ITS OK TO USE MURDERED BABY MEAT AND INJECT IT INTO PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD??? WAKE UP PEOPLE WE ARE IN THE DAYS OF THE SECOND COMING, GOD SAID IN THE PROPHECY OF THE HOLY BIBE THERE WILL BE "PESTILENCE" ( THAT MEANS EPIDEMIC) BEFORE HE RETURNS AGAIN , AND NEXT TIME WONT BE A FLOOD, IT WILL BE BY FIRE!

1	Just got mine today, Pfizer , no symptoms at all
1	Vaccines save children and their parents time and money.
0	If you get it, you get it, if you don’t, you don’t. No prevention.
0	Yeah I'm not getting this vaccine I don't know wtf is in it .
0	The risk of death from covid-19 is also very low
1	I got my second Pfizer dose on the 28th and today I can eat at all the restaurants in Portugal and be less scared for my family’s well being
1	Not had any Covid vaccine and not going to have one either. Sky News' financial donor Bill Gates, said in 2020 "not absolutely everybody needs a vaccine." So I've gone with that, coupled with the lack of mid and long term side effects data plus I've had Covid and as I work with the general public 4 days a week, I've not contracted it again (so far, since 2020) I'm guessing my immune system is fully functional!
0	Why should I inject my body with ingredients they won't disclose? It doesn't prevent transmission or infection....so why??
1	Other people might be happy to contract COVID but for me being unable to work for a week is simply not an option, so I intend to get myself boostered as often as possible.
0	I trust my ....my immune system LoL
0	Some of yall gonna have 8 shots in ya by the end of next summer and still be catching it. I know I know at least we aint being hospitalized and dying. That's a lie also
1	You know that COVID itself has been linked to some of these issues. It's interesting that you are only focused on the possibility that the vaccine is responsible for any alleged upticks.
1	The benefits outweigh the risks
0	You should be in prison for forcing that cocktail on your kid.
0	Where I live, which is the state of Mississippi, we have the most sick children in America. And we are one of only three states where vaccines are forced if you want your children to actually go to school. We are the one state with the most sick children and we are the state who gives the most vaccines.
0	yeah the passport is apparently a way to control us and take away our civil rights for not been obedient and taking the poison.
0	My aunt took 2 doses of the vaccine and now she's really really sick. And then you see persons also dying, getting seizures and heart attacks.
1	Ever wonder why conspiracy theorists never get taken seriously? Enlighten me with how anti vaxxers who have been historically against every vaccine released are still not being taken seriously about the covid 19 ones? Ever wonder when their narrative is debunked they either go on a triggered rant or just go plain silent? That’s right, because they made it all up or followed Facebook groups who make it all up. It’s not hard to understand is it?
1	I want to get a second shot of Pfizer vaccine.
0	I will wait until human trials end in 2023.
1	The reason vaccines are being “pushed” has nothing to do with conspiracies, and everything to do with the fact that we are living through a public health crisis like we have not seen in our lifetimes.
1	Most non-vaccinated people that I have spoken to always say “they’re afraid of the vaccine.” My response to them is “I’m more afraid of Covid than the vaccine !”
1	But VACCINES can save your live definitely. I mean lower the symptoms
1	There is overwhelming scientific support for the fact that vaccines work and that the benefits of the vaccine far outweighs the risk.
0	Obviously there will be side effects. What’s more disturbing will be the regular booster shots that may cause (if too regimentally administered) irreversible damage
0	Breaking News! The corona virus is weakening and does not threaten the lives everyone. In addition the vaccine does not prevent transmission. These two facts make mandates unscientific. This must be about money rather than health.
1	i got my vaccine 2 days ago (note that its a 5-11 vaccine) Idk if this is abnormal but i had no side effects. Not even my arm was sore
0	This is most dangerous "vaccine" ever produced. It also has negative efficacy.
1	Dude, vaccines work.
1	The majority of those getting covid are the unvaccinated, however you can still get covid if you're vaccinated but you are less likely to end up in hospital or die.
0	If you still want the vaccine you can get it, you just can't require anyone else to. Still, I'm sure the government will find a way around this.
0	Please let this be safe.....way easier to administer and seemingly more effective.
0	Covid shot does not stop you from catching it or passing it on
0	Why are people saying "get vaccinated, it save lives" when vaccinated people are still getting Covid?
0	Others do not allow themselves to be vaccinated on principle - for medical or curative reasons, with esoteric, anthroposophical, religious and ideological justifications.
0	40 yrs no shots of any kind. I’m fine. Probably had a hand full of colds. I kick them off quickly with over the counter meds. Had covid kicked it in three days, wife got covid 10 months later, I did not reinfect. Why? My daughter and family just got the delta covid. All of us together. My wife and I, did not reinfect. Why? I know that my immune system is in full working order. I do not approve of a experimental shot, that could potentially give me one of several things. All of what I do not want or need. TY very much..1.GBS 2. Paralyzed 3. Shakes 4. Wanes in 60 days 5. Death. Pg 65 of Pfizer blind trails. Death.. WHY does our rotten government and media not tell us ALL THE TRUTH?. Why?.. they just keep pushing this vax. Suspicious to any intelligent person.. Fauci should be held accountable.. period
0	To all my unvaxxed brethren out there: HOLD THE LINE!!!
1	It's not longer "experimental" it's more of an actual medication now. My friend got his vaccines and nothing has happened at all. My teachers have also gotten theirs and again nothing has happened.
0	The only folks who should get the booster are those at risk with co-morbidities. Millions of people (myself included) know dozens of people who regret the vaccine due to side effects and will not get boosted.
0	Perfectly executed with exactly the right amount of vague science, guilt and fear, coming from the mouth a young, kind-looking, relatable woman. Mmmhmmm.
1	I got vaccinated because no one likes wearing a mask. No one likes social distancing. No one likes restaurants being closed for dine in service. No one likes being away from loved ones. No one likes covid. The more I can do now the sooner this can be reduced as much as possible!
0	no protection from vaccine, just profit...profit...profit
1	Distance... Always and everywhere (and no,not Just 1 meter) but 4 or 5. And desinfect your hands. Done
0	Hats off to those who haven't allowed themselves, or their families, fall victim to the psychopaths behind the plandemic and their needles !
1	Hopefully we’ll get to some sort of place soon where proof of vaccination is required to live a normal life and it won’t be just cheap talk if you want to skip a vaccine.
0	many are tired of life and how many sleep under the bridge and find it difficult to take responsibility for society as a whole because they no longer belong to it anyway?
1	i’m 18 and i can’t walk up the stairs without becoming out of breath. i was healthy and working out 4-5 times a week before i got covid. please get the vaccine if you are able
1	I got it because I don't want to get covid. Just like I got a lot of other vaccinations because I didn't want to get the disease.
0	For a man who has openly stated that overpopulation is a problem, he is oddly concerned with saving lives with the vaccine?
1	I take Covaxin ... Indian made
0	YOU Fully Vaccinated are the Super Spreaders and You Shed NEW Mutations!
0	Just imagine ... imagine a vaccine so safe you have to be threatened to take it.
1	In my opinion mix and match with differeent brands purely depends upon person to person and need to consult own physician before getting it. Its probably ok to take dose1 of MODERNA and dose2 of PFIZER or vice versa, since these vaccines are nearly identical.
0	Given the fact the first two shots failed, why would someone sign up for 3rd dose?
1	The reason that we keep getting mutations is because people refuse to get vaccinated. If everybody got vaccinated, the virus would stop mutating.
0	let me see, those that have been fully vaccinated are still getting COVID. those that have gotten the booster are still getting COVID. I guess we are not getting vaccinated because we know that the vaccines do nothing to protect people from COVID and that COVID is so deadly that only 99.9997% will survive. that is all posted on the CDC website.
1	For the people who not taking it, I understand. I just don't wanna hear any complaining from them if shit gets shut down again or if they bar non-vaccinated people from certain things
1	My eldest (19) has asthma and now Covid. Symptoms are thankfully mild as we didn’t raise a knucklehead so she’s vaccinated and boosted. #VaccinesWork
1	How do you trust science enough to remove your heart and put in someone else’s but a vaccine is a bridge to far? Make it make sense.
1	They should have mandated vaccine period.
0	When are we going to talk about natural immunity? Getting the vaccine is not a one size fits all.
1	Its simple we remove the anti vaccination people from the gene pool then they can't water it down with their stupidity
0	And the r / Canada thread is proclaiming how great the vaccine is working. fuckin lol
0	We are not protected by the vaccine,when we had the vaccine our health is not safe anymore,i feel it now.and i knew some of my friends completed the vaccine still catch the virus and I'm fully vaccinated too. i felt that i get more weaker ,your killing people
0	Can we talk about the many that took it and died? There's plenty, and apparently those stats are not interesting news
0	Even if you are not conspiracy minded, something in your soul has to be telling you something isn't right with any of this
1	Vaccine is not a something you do for yourself, do it for others!
1	I'm getting mine as soon as it's available for me! My grandmother for her first phizer vaccine today and is doing very well so far.
1	Sorry id rather listen to professional scientists professors not a layman whos blinded by whats really happening ,
0	It is impossible to do all the test so fast
1	get vaccinated for yourself and the others.
0	First time in history that the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who haven't taken it.
0	I'm not getting it because my mom's friend had half her face drop down and go dumb! Wanna explain that? That happened after she took it! HM?
1	#COVIDIOTS are so dangerous all around the world! If everyone would just get vaxxed and boosted, we would have no hospital surges!
0	Hey look! More fake juice requiring 50 booster shots.
1	I do research on what motivates people to get the shot in Mississippi. The number one predictor for a vaccine hesitant person to get the shot is to have conversations with people they trust about it. Usually it’s family but doesn’t have to be.
1	Ok, so one person in the US has died from a Covid vaccine. 575,000 have died of Covid. It’s still an easy choice to get vaccinated. Also, one of the long term effects of Covid in people that survive the initial acute phase is blood clots. So...it’s a good idea to get vaccinated.
1	the only way to avoid getting infected by the deadly Covid19 virus is to CONTINUE to PRACTICE the HEALTH PROTOCOL of SOCIAL DISTANCING, WEARING of FACE MASK & FACE SHIELD in CROWDED AREA or PLACE & WASHING YOUR HANDS EVERY TIME YOU TOUCH Any thing.
1	You know what does disrupt a woman’s menstrual cycle? Stress, anxiety, illness. This pandemic year has really disrupted cycles, not the vaccines
1	The vaccine is good. I don't like how serious the pressure is from some people is to get it but it is a just a good idea to get it.
1	unvaccinated people had infection rates 3.6 times higher than people who had received boosters and hospitalization rates were 23 times higher. I have come to the conclusion that the unvaccinated do not understand numbers, either that or they believe when they die there will be 72 Stormy Daniels waiting for them
0	The effects of over vaccination are ENORMOUS. It doesn't just effect the Covid virus by mutation, it also effects other organs in the body including the immune system. This is why those vaccinated are not just showing up in hospitals with Covid, but other organ failures as well. The immune system is designed to protect those organs and when you start compromising it, it becomes confused and destroys specific antibodies it need to protect the body. The conspiracy theories are coming true. The unvaxxed and those with natural immunity are in a much better boat than those vaxxed. Sorry. We warned you
0	Why is anybody getting this rushed out vaccine?! You’re literally signing up for real time clinical trials.
0	Does anyone still believe what "they" tell us?.....
1	I remember being amazed when the COVID-19 vaccine was made so quickly, and after watching this, I am even more amazed by how revolutionary this new way of making vaccines is. An applause to everybody who contributed in making and giving out these wonderful stuff. And thank you for the good video.
0	250 kids under 5 have died from covid in the last two years. This isn't about saving lives, it's about money. Absolutely disgusting.
0	Vaccine is not the answer. God is the answer. Only God can stop this. But many people dont want to live in obedience to God.
1	I got my booster shot of biontech vaccine 2 days ago. I hope everyone follow health official recommendations to protect us all against new variants.
1	Man, I *wish* the vaccine had a 5G tracking chip in it. Maybe my phone's data would finally work like it's supposed to, and Google maps wouldn't show me as being on a road I'm not on when I'm trying to find someplace new.
0	Seriously turn off your tv and go read some data. Children have more chance of dying from the flu. .002% chance of dying. They’ll probably get hit by a car before they get seriously sick with Covid unless they have severe health issues. The vaccine has no benefit, still catch it
0	I think all vaccines look good right now. They all essentially use the same antigens. Even if some of the vaccines won't protect from disease they might protect from severe disease and death. We will see but it seems that SARS-CoV-2 is a "vaccinable" virus.
0	These companies aren’t liable if your injured in the process. Stop and think about that!
1	Hooligans. I know it feels like ancient advice at this point, but, keep wearing masks while maintaining social distancing. Get vaccinated and boosted. Get that flu shot, too. Stay smart. Stay healthy. I want you around.
1	Thank you for creating this video. It's very frustrating to read all the anti vaccine comments all over the internet. Even here in Switzerland, where we supposedly have very good general education there's an alarming rise of people spreading misinformation.
1	Anti-vaxxers have below average IQ. Fact
1	One of my best friends just lost her life two days ago because she chose not to be vaccinated. I didn’t know until she was sick and in ICU. Her last words she posted on FB, “unless your pregnant and your Dr., tells you NOT to get vaccinated, “GET THE DAMN SHOTS! This virus is just miserable and not worth it
1	I agree that everyone needs to do their patriotic duty as was embraced when polio hit! Get vaccinated stop listening to misinformation !
1	Why would you rather listen to some random person on YouTube, than doctors and scientists? The millions who've already died from Covid would envy your chance of getting protected by a vaccine.
0	My mom had a friend who shortly after the vaccine was hospitalized with extremely high blood pressure and has had nerve problems ever since
0	In simple terms the vaccine is useless.

0	Someone needs three years to realise that this is not about a pandemic
1	The unvaccinated are to blame for hospitals being overcrowded and this winter going to be a fcking shit storm for everyone.
1	I got to get out of  this place.. Ugg can't live another year with  this hate. Has anyone else lost friends because you and your family got vaccinated? I just  don't know how to keep living around people so stupid.
1	"The vaccine is still experimental in phase 4" Yes, it is in phase 4, which is normal, and that does not make it an experimental vaccine: Phases 1 and 2 ensure tolerance and safety  Phase 3 ensures efficacy Phase 4 is the post-marketing pharmacovigilance follow-up
1	I got Moderna .. No problems here
1	I am fully vaccinated and the peace of mind I feel is the opposite of the helplessness I felt for so long. Living with a fully vaccinated person as well. I'm very grateful.
1	Not getting a vaccine harms other people.
0	Animals don’t need vaccines, so why do humans need to have them?
1	The amount of work necessary to prove bullshit is significantly larger than to just come up with the bullshit.
0	Ownwrs of Moderna are criminals. They bribed doctors to promote their vaccine which is illegal.
0	I'm not an "anti-vaxxer." I've had many vaccines. Just not this one. Not yet. Too new, too rushed.
0	I keep seeing too many people talking about someone they know dropping dead 2-3 weeks after the booster shots from a heart attack. Why the hell would I wanna go get vaccinated?
0	No way in the world will I be getting that stuff put into my body
0	When discussing education they state that those without a college education are less likely to get vaccinated, but purposely leave out that those with a PHD are also less likely to get  vaccinated. Guess it doesn't fit the narrative.
0	Vaccines bring u CLOSER TO DEATH
0	I'm not taking the vax. Just to much stuff happening to people that have had it.
0	that vaccine has given me a massive flu, fever and all my bones are aching
0	The pandemic is fake people. Stay woke.
1	Even cats are no covid idiots and wear a mask, and they´re also no anti vaxxers, even though they hate injections they usually let the vet give them the most necessary vaccinations, so what´s the problem about some humans???
0	Patient to Doctor: "Does it provide immunity?" Doctor: "Only for the manufacturer,
1	"They do not tell us what the vaccines are made out of". The damn vaccines  have a label of contents. "They do not tell us what my microwave pizza is made out of" is as valid of an argument.
0	we just believe their word do we...absolutely NOT. Jog on!!
0	Somewhat, same has been said with the CV19 jab. Yet, current CV19 jabs can't completely neutralise SCV2.
1	Wow fantastic news!! God bless you phizer
1	Wow it’s almost like the vaccines work
1	The vaccine is far less risky than Covid.
1	how is it a so called vaccine? Science is supposed to change and have new technologies. I got 3 shots. I'm perfectly healthy with no problems and have never once tested positive for covid-19.
1	idols finally getting vaxxed yaas
0	If it worked why do it so many times over and over? Naaaa you keep it
1	I’m a Clinical Nurse Specialist with over a decade of experience in nursing & a Masters in Public Health. I have had my 3 #CovidVaccine’s and recommended that all my family & friends do the same.
1	The next big issue will be to convince people to take the vaccine
1	I think people that step forward to advocate against the vaccine, have drawn attention to themselves. If they die its ripe for public discussion not a strictly private matter
0	Not had any Covid vaccine and not going to have one either. Sky News' financial donor Bill Gates, said in 2020 "not absolutely everybody needs a vaccine." So I've gone with that, coupled with the lack of mid and long term side effects data plus I've had Covid and as I work with the general public 4 days a week, I've not contracted it again (so far, since 2020) I'm guessing my immune system is fully functional!
1	Personally I'm pro vaccines
1	Thank you!  you’ve convinced me to get the shot. Getting it tomorrow
1	I wouldn't want you taking care of me in a hospital if you're a HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL and still refuse it. What, exactly, is it that is stopping you? What, precisely, is in that vaccine or what about is the reason you're not taking it? I imagine you'll ignore my question like every single other antivax person who just avoids it because they, like you, don't know.
1	From my point of view I agree with some experts argue that preventing any infection at all is not always the point of vaccine, the goal of vaccine program for Covid-19 is not necessarily to get to 'Covid Zero' but to remove its ability to cause serious disease, hospitalization and death.
0	It's evil they only want people to take the vaccine, snuffing out all these other alternatives. The government doesn't care about people but for some reason people have a religious faith in their "leaders". This never should have happened!
0	Nice presentation, loved the animation, but Still ain’t getting vaccinated
0	If it becomes "mandatory", I'll just pay the nurse to shoot it in the sink and record that I had it. I'm never accepting this fraud.
1	Nice for russian, china, indonesia, iran and other... Their already starts vaccination.
1	I have seen many people who got vaccinated with covidshield are totally fine and some of them just had fever and took a paracetamol and got good again. You don't have any other option either get vaccinated and be safe or survive without vaccination and boost up your immunity
1	I am going to get vaccinated because as a citizens of my country it is my duty to protect my fellow country men from getting sick from covid 19
1	I got vaxxed because it was the height of the pandemic and I had a small baby at home while working with prek kids at school. It has been great!
1	It’s never too late to get your 1st dose to protect yourself and your community
1	BTW the vaccines are effective against the variants.
1	Taking the vaccine and having bad side effects far outweighs catching the virus and falling ill. Plus it’s been a tough 18 months for everyone, I got vaccinated to help end this real life horror movie we’ve all been living through.
1	thank you so much for easing certain doubts.... a few of us nursing students will be getting the vaccine soon and i think we'll take our chances! ?
1	Incredible video! If these anti-vaxxers still are not convinced by this video, I don't know what convinces them anymore.
0	First time in history that the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who haven't taken it.
1	If somebody doesn’t get it it’s their fault kids around the world can’t have Halloween this year
0	My Grandmother, 95 years old, survived COVID but died two days after her second shot just a week ago. No one in my family is getting it after that happened.
0	Not getting one and I know I’m not alone. The country will have a massive problem on their hands if they try to make vaccines “mandatory”
0	This is wrong. You can’t force somebody to vaccinate. You can ask the m to stay away until they do, and they may feel coerced, but my right to safety is greater than their right to be negligent.
1	To those still unvaccinated, is it worth potentially losing smell and taste permanently, or even 10k or more in hospital bills? Not everyone has million dollar contracts that can afford hospital bills like those.
0	I'm still not getting the shot.
0	My colleague at work, 24 years old and fit and healthy. Supposedly had covid in December as she tested positive after her flat mate had it, but no symptoms and didn't know she actually had it. Received the vaccine yesterday as she is a frontline worker, within an hour she felt Ill, shaking and achy. Within the next hour felt even worse. Eventually an ambulance was called and was taken to hospital as she couldn't breathe properly. Had to be put on a breathing machine, her words, for a few hours while lots of tests carried out. Was told that she isn't the only person this has happened to and the younger people seem to be reacting worse. Still in hospital and waiting on test results. Obviously this is not the normal reaction but why should healthy people be made to feel they have to take the vaccine.
1	This was helpful. I'm so tired of the anti-vaxxers out in full force, protesting in the streets!
1	The notion that natural immunity is better than vaccines has been a dangerous lie for centuries. People need to know the facts instead of listening to the disinformation dozen and their hoax alternative health claims in an attempt to make money out of the ones who believe them
0	Let us see the side effects, if it is SO SAFE. If not stop pushing ..thank you.
1	Just got mine today, Pfizer , no symptoms at all
0	So what do you think the 6 people who got blood clots? Vaccine still safe ?
0	Horse manure. I am a marine and I volunteer my blood 4 times a year. Ain't at all scared...... of the needle. But what is in it......
0	All to scare people into taking the poison shots... The real vaxxed are now carriers of the real virus that spreads to the un-vaxxed.... Be aware, stay away from the vaxxed.....
1	Covid vaccines are working remarkably well at preventing severe disease and death—even from Omicron, which evades some of our immunity. If you're not up-to-date with your vaccination, get vaccinated ASAP.
0	What percentage of the vaccines were fabricated immorally? All 3 approved by the USDA were fabricated immorally. Do the right thing, not the evil selfish thing.
0	Several people I know who have been vaccinated still ended up getting the virus in the months following 2nd shot and boosters. Not only that, they also had severe discomfort caused by the vaccine itself in the days following inoculation.
0	Can someone make a vaccine to protect us against political lies???
1	I am not against the vaccine and I think everyone should get it although I did have some side effects
0	You didn't mention the bit about the vaccines being given under EUA Emergency Use Authorisation because they have not yet completed regular approval process.
1	already got my booster shot !
1	vaccine remain very efficient in preventing hospitalisations and deaths
0	PARENTS SHOULD REALLY THINK TWICE BFORE THEY VACCINATE THERE CHILDREN
0	I'll never take it
1	Dude I survived a car crash before, so do we really even need seat belts and air bags? Think of all the potential danger seat belts and air bags pose! What if I strangle myself or something? Idk just seems like those are more dangerous than the car crashes since, you know, I survived before -Anti-vax argument in a nutshell
1	I was fortunate to grow up in the 1950s, when vaccines were required to attend public schools. That makes me old enough to remember older kids that were tragically paralyzed for life polio victims from the time before the Salk vaccine was available.
0	I'm scared and wont take the vaccine, too many downsides with it and people still get the flu even after their 3 shots
0	Natural infection immunity is always superior to vaccine immunity, any dr knows this
0	Places where there is high vaccination rates Covid cases are off the charts
1	Get vaccinated! Trump did!
1	And what do we do with this information now? Even if an infection protects better than a vaccination, I still prefer the vaccination. Anything else would mean that I would voluntarily become infected, and that would seem pretty stupid to me.
1	Us vaccinated folks eating well tonight. Sucks to suck anti vaxx losers.
0	What goes into ones body should be a matter of self choice and not force! Regardless of whatever the consequence, that is the bedrock of the human choice, God given free-will and the right of every human being.
0	The vaccine puts lives at risk! You get over the flu and get healthier can't say the same for people that are putting the vaccine in their body!
0	Idk never wore a mask never took a vaccine still didn't got COVID
1	Wear a mask. Get a shot. Might need a booster. Grave sacrifices to personal freedom? Really??? It’s not as if we’re asking you to storm the beaches at Normandy. It's the bare minimum to help save your life and maybe the lives of others - including children. Smdh.
0	You are not forced to take it. Stay strong
0	No way in the world will I be getting that vaxx put into my body.
1	There are still people around the world who need access to life-saving vaccines. We're in a country where they were provided early and for free, but people still refused because of freedumb.
0	As each day goes on, I am beyond thankful to myself for not being forced into taking a #Covid19Vaccine Like it’s clearly all unravelling.
1	If you get the vaccine, you won't get covid
0	If the government wants to help restaurants, all they need to do is stop spreading fear and panic.
1	Got my second dose last week, was a little tired for a couple days after but not sure if it was because of the vaccine or because of dealing with home repairs.
0	if you havent been vaccinated yet, take this as a sign to not get it. The truth will come out soon
0	Taking the vaccine in exchange for the hope on an easier progression of the illness, is like cutting off your leg to avoid athletes foot!
0	Because you're all guineapigs, vaccine is still under trial until 2023.
1	Great stuff, a great shame that such clear non-politicised facts have not been the norm.
1	That being said, please get vaccinated if you are medically eligible for it.
0	It’s so rare, it keeps happening. I’m good with my natural immunity thanks.
1	Fortunately, I felt fine after my first shot recently, but my upper arm (where I got the shot) got pretty sore about 8 hrs after the shot, but I'm doing well, I presently feel no ill affects
0	The easiest way to find out how to combat the pathogen is how the human body did it naturally. That way there will be no side effects. Unlike the current vaccine that has shown side effects. Side effects from just pain in the arm to blood clots forming that leads to a stroke.
0	No - you simply can’t “trust” that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe.I have had problems with vaccines before, from spending a few days in bed after flu shots to spending 4 months at home with a ‘kidney infection’ and paralysis after the polio vaccine in 1963. At least 10% of the polio vaccine was contaminated with SV40, a kidney virus. The vaccine is a ‘novel’ vaccine to a ‘novel’ virus that has been rushed to market. Respected scientists and doctors have expressed concerns over both the vaccine test design and the possible manipulation of test data. We have no long term data re safety or durability of the vaccine. The short term data is revealing an alarming number and array of symptoms and deaths that are being dismissed as coincidental. Dividing adverse effect into types for each vaccine and say each type is rare for that vaccine is a ploy. Moreover, “rare” is a subjective term that is meaningless if it affect you or yours. Pontificating the the ‘benefit is worth the risk’ is an immoral dictate that ignores the risk to individuals in different demographics. The emergency use authorization (EUA) means the FDA does not do quality control inspections of manufacturing. Vaccine manufacturers have made millions of vials of their product which is ready to ship without having FDA approval or vetted data while the media pounds on the drums to rush this along. This is marketing, not medical science
0	Yet Im unvaccinated work in the nhs and not had a day off sick for the past 4 years but get sacked on 31st March thanks then
0	Heres another reason i wont take it...#stop #VaccineSideEffects
0	Please w.h.o I'm sick with climate change when will the booster be ready....
1	I got sick off both my Moderna vaccines but I'm so glad I'm vaccinated. well done x
1	Happy one year anniversary to me and my vaccine! I had no idea the next year of the pandemic would involve more CDC fuckups, finding out family are antivaxxers, having a relative die of Covid, getting a 3rd shot and being due for a 4th soon, or me being back in lockdown.
1	Done with my first dose and waiting for the second dose.
0	Will your job keep you on if you become disabled due to vaccine? My aunt now has heart complications after vaccine. Now she fears becoming laid off due to those complications. A few days after 2nd dose, she went into her first only seizure and mini coma, with doctors unable to explain it. Now she has needs to constantly monitor her heart pressure.
0	Getting vaccinated don’t mean nothing nothing ppl who have got it still caught COVID and died.
0	I agree don't get a booster.
0	Covid-19 isn’t seen as a threat
0	"We can reduce the population by 15 percent if we do a really good job with vaccines and reproductive health services"- bill eugenics gates
1	Get vaccinated or risk disease and death.
1	Keep Up figthing against Coronavirus,let's get all Vaccines!!! I'm very proud and respecfull also would like to saying thank you for everyones especialy to all health Workers around the world,may God blessed you guys all
0	You're allowed to question medicine. But not vaccines. Never vaccines!
0	Taking the vaccine in exchange for the hope on an easier progression of the illness, is like cutting off your leg to avoid athletes foot!
0	My reason is that we don't know what the long term side effects are
0	I am afraid of Covid Vaccine. Is there any side effect..no injection yet on my arm.
0	It will likely give many people cancer
1	vaccines are a game-changing tool
0	Why is it not ok to keep our own immune systems up with a variety of ways instead of this nonsense vaxx???!
0	A forced injection is the wrong answer, in my opinion.
1	trust the vaccine to do it's purpose.  believe the science.  please and thank you.
1	Anti-vaxxers telling us they’re not going to take the vaccine. Again. Smh
1	One of the first vaccines receivers in the US. Momentous for science. Hope has arrived.
0	I wouldn't be giving the vaccine to my kids.  Bad enough that I got the jab myself.
0	Maderna vaccine is still under emergency exemption and these idiots are talking about allowing them to give people boosters.
0	Take your shots. I like my immune system instead
0	I had covid- 19 three months ago so I have the antibodies so why do i need more antibodies from a jab? it doesn't make sense as I've allready been vaccinated naturally.
1	got my pfizer vaccine 2 days ago and my arm really hurt on the first day, but it's getting better. get ur vaccine yall and hope that this pandemic ends
0	I only hope there is going to be a choice to recived or rejected. I will rejected till end or till they make me on force to recived.
1	I was surprised my devout catholic, trump supporting, fox news watching parents got the vaccine right when it was available to them.
0	Don't understand those who are pro. If I got three polio vaccines in a year and still got polio, I'd be asking questions.
0	The vaccines reduced transmissibility of earlier variants but they didn’t provide immunity against transmission. If they had provided immunity breakthrough infections wouldn’t have been a thing.
0	search results from the vaers database 'found 329 cases where vaccine targets covid-19 and patient died'.. No vaccine please
0	Hahahah we all are fucked. Pfizer and Gates have us now
1	It’s amazing, and should be something we are all excited about. A HUGE advancement in the medical field and will change the future of vaccines. It’s a shame partisanship and drama is putting a damper on that.
0	We stand with our truckers in the USA and in Canada. No vaccine mandate!
1	Follow the science! I support vaccines
1	Great start. Hopefully the rate of vaccination goes up significantly
1	Sooner or later, the coronavirus hits us all. If you are vaccinated, at worst you will be flat at home for a few days and not in intensive care.
0	I had covid19 a year ago but my body overcame it and I refused to get vaccinated
0	SPONSORED BY PFIZER!!!!
1	After being pinged a week ago, I’ve stayed negative. Feeling grateful for my armour of triple vaccine + mask.
0	if vaccines aren't profitable, nobody makes them. MONEY TALKS :) They still haven't made any vaccin against HIV virus...
0	I’m not just going to get on a bandwagon like the rest and just get the vaccine”
1	So, according to anti-vacers, 930,000 doctors and over 800,000 pharmaceutical l scientist and lab techs are wrong.
0	I don't give a shit. I'm not going to be forced to take an experimental vaccine for a mild virus.
0	Clearly the vaccine doesn't work otherwise why are people being reinfected 2 or 3 times?
1	So its 75% effect of keeping you out of hospital, last time I looked 75% was good!
0	The protected need to be protected from the unprotected by forcing the unprotected to use the protection that didn't protect the protected
1	I got my vaccine and I advocate for other to get vaccinated but this seems like we re headed down a path you can t come back from by forcing people to get vaccinated. Idk but this doesn t seem like cause for celebration
0	why are you trying to force something on me I don't want?
1	Every week, millions of people are currently taking care of a vaccination appointment in order to protect themselves from a life-threatening course of the disease in the event of a Covid 19 infection. It is fortunate that such a large majority keeps their nerve in the crisis and acts prudently.
1	Omicron does appear to be less severe compared to Delta, especially in those vaccinated
0	Side effects:  I died, but starting to feel better.
0	More nonsense. There is no test for covid and it does not exist, no virus exists or ever has,it's pure BS pseudoscience and fraud.
1	All those data from hospitals are against unvaccinated people, but still noone seems to care.
1	I literally cried when I got my vaccine from utter happiness.
0	Sports men and women dying after the so called vaccines.
0	I would rather get omicron twice than Thrombosis from vector vaccine
0	I’m proud to be NOT vaccinated and proud to have that right over my own body and not fall victim to the propaganda, BS and lies! Vaccines are harming 1000s of people. I’ve had Covid and was fine. It’s a flu. I sleep well knowing I don’t have to worry about the vaccine injuries!!
1	it's amazing how quickly a vaccine was created for this pandemic with a high effective rate to boot. Modern science is amazing. The power of science.
0	Shove your vaccine
1	“It’s easier to fool someone than convince theme they’ve been fooled”-Mark Twain
0	The sheep can't understand why..
1	Thanks Doctor, you convinced me, I will get the shot :)
1	My mom went back to work today. My dad's going back tomorrow. I couldn't be happier that things are getting back to normal this week and once again, so grateful I still did not catch Covid. Thank God for this damn vaccine.
0	Not vaccinating is the safest way to live
1	There's never anything to worry about when it comes to this liquid. It is perfection. I always laugh when I see the headline "FDA begins trials to determine safety in people under 30" "under 20" "under 10" "under 5" "under 2" "newborns" "pregnant women" "women who WANT to get pregnant" "men's reproductive abilities" "people with heart issues" --- the answer is always SAFE SAFE SAFE SAFE APPROVED APPROVED APPROVED
0	Risk is high, benefits are non
0	Sorry to hear about your situation, but he/she is correct. Being vaccinated doesn't stop you from catching or spreading the virus. Here is an idea - you can wear a chemsuit when someone visits. Prior to taking the suit off, open up all of the windows to circulate fresh air and hopefully remove any lingering COVID aerosols in the house.
1	got my #BoosterDose yesterday
0	I can’t wait to get my 27th booster tomorrow. It’s been a week since my last, I haven’t felt like I’ve been in a safe space the past few days.
0	No vaccine for me!
1	They need to develope trust and explain how it works to get people to take it.... No. NO MEANS NO, no further words needed
0	I am vaccinated against Polio and Smallpox.  I never asked anyone ever if they were vaccinated against these diseases
0	What is the truth about AstraZeneca's Covid vaccine and blood clots?  You cannot undo dead. Thanks to shit like this, my Aunt died. YOU take that shit. Not for me. Not now, not ever. Fuck that shit. I choose to have 0% chance of falling prey to pharmaceutical murder.
0	Fuck vaccines. From a mom who’s son suffered from a severe reaction resulting in a diagnosis of autism. FUCK OFF.
1	Booster Dosage  01.02.2022
0	The mrna vaccines blocks your natural adaptive immunity which explains the skyrocketing cases in fully vaccinated nations
0	It is not even a vaccine at this point. I guess it’s only “follow the science” when it’s convenient for them.
1	My eldest son and I got our booster today. No hate, just love!
1	Anti-vaccers, just accept that you are none too bright, in a Dunning Kruger manner.
1	The freaks don’t care how many boosts you want to take. The freaks are upset because they don’t want to be forced to take them. If you’re concerned for yourself or your loved ones, then you all should get boosted.
1	I just got the first vaccine. My arm is a little sore (the same amount of soreness I get from a flu shot). That's the only symptom. I feel perfectly fine otherwise!
0	If the vaccine works but I don't want it in my body, would you be offended?
0	First time in history that the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who haven't taken it.
0	I am not taking the vaccines
0	STOP with the emotional blackmail. Herd immunity is the only way forward. anyone who is worried about catching it. STAY UNDER YOUR BED.
0	When you eat healthy and have a strong immune system your body can fight any virus. There is no need for a vaccine.
0	Okay I'll start. This will make it very easy for you to try and convince me otherwise. - Vax doesn't stop transmission -covid small harm to kids -small chance of harm to young males from Vax. How does it benefit you, and my 3-year-old by getting the vaccine? Please tell.
1	Side effects happen, but are often far less disruptive and dangerous to life than the actual disease. Its sad that this is even an argument.
1	It can be argued that the unknown effects of covid presents the same problems except possibly worse. We don’t know anything about this new virus, and it’s a big virus as far as viruses are concerned, with a lot of spikes - it possibly has a lot of tricks up it’s sleeve. Like chickenpox, it could lay dormant in your spine for years and present itself later on as shingles - wIt’s covid we don’t know. At least the vaccine has gone through trials - covid is doing its own trial on our population and it is doing quite a doozy. If areas keep on spreading we don’t know what could happen. We are lucky this virus is mild as far as viruses go, it could be far worse, infecting kids etc…. I say vaccinate.
1	Adverse reactions to vaccines are extremely rare.
1	I stand behind Dr. Fauci and the amazing job that he is doing. I am doubled masked, double vaxxed, boosted, and socially distant. We need to trust the science which means listening to experts like Dr Fauci. The solution is simple: we need to enforce the vaccine mandate for everyone (including children), create a booster mandate, and enforce an N95 mask mandate. It's not that hard and anyone who does not comply should start facing some serious consequences
1	From the Texas Department of State Health Services: "In the September time frame, unvaccinated people in their 40s were 55 times more likely to die from COVID-19 compared with fully vaccinated people of the same age." 11/2021
0	Poorly tested vaccine
1	This is an especially important video during these times, to encourage everyone to get vaccinated and reduce the spread of COVID-19
1	Protect yourself and get vaccinated
0	You are dead !! World horror organization kills people !! its a depopulation agenda of Bill gates, WHO , USA and UN !!
1	Thank you for creating this video. It's very frustrating to read all the anti vaccine comments all over the internet. Even here in Switzerland, where we supposedly have very good general education there's an alarming rise of people spreading misinformation.
0	Why don’t we just come out and say it, we don’t trust the government….
1	About two-thirds of Americans support the requirement that all people in a health care setting be vaccinated against COVID-19
0	How are they safe and it’s not even FDA approved
0	you are NOT protecting anyone. You are only putting money into the hands of big Pharma and putting yourself in harms way…
1	Anti-vaxxers are almost worse because their ignorance is blatant
0	Imagine a vaccine that’s so effective that you also need to protect the protected from the unprotected.
1	Not wanting to be vaccinated is one thing, this is terrorism. I cant agree that's something nice. People who want the vaccine (myself included) should not have to fear something like this happening
0	Fuck Pfizer and Fuck Vaccine Mandates!
1	Thank you and glad you are getting some upvotes and awards for going against the anti-vax nonsense. I've been a conservative most of my life and was a T_D mod, but the anti-vax/mask crap I see in conservative circles sometimes drives me insane. Yes there are some risks associated with vaccines (that's why they do clinical trials after all) but they are tiny compared with the health risk posed by COVID: it's a no-brainer, especially with full FDA approval. Go get your shot if you haven't already (and put your mask on too while you're at it).
0	The long term side effects have never been done for mRNA vax have they? You mention that it's very rare to see significant side effects for other vaccines but they are not mRNA.
0	It’s so rare, it keeps happening. I’m good with my natural immunity thanks.
1	Yes I plan to. Covid is dangerous and if everyone would get the vaccine we would have far less problems.
1	I got 2 booster shots, it works
0	Show me the evidence!?!?! THATS HILARIOUS! As they ask for 50-75 YEARS TO SHOW YOU THE EVIDENCE THAT IT WORKS!
1	I’ll tell you, I got covid like a few days ago before being tested positive and until the real symptoms kicked in. Trust me, it sucked. But I’m feeling better and I’m slowly recovering
1	I'm in support of the vaccine, and seeing people be bullied for sharing their experiences in the covid vaccine subreddits (and general lack of compassion for those having a hard time with it) has been extremely disappointing. Shunning people talking about their side effects also prevents people who are scared/worried from building a support circle with others going through the same thing. Especially since there is so much uncertainty and fear about this new vaccine.
1	Spend a day in a full ICU, talk to the nurses, doctors, respiratory therapists, pulmonologists, find out how many patients are vaccinated. Read about variants & how they're an unknown & a race against time. Stop whining & don't simplify your argument to fit your narrative.
0	We are born with perfect immune systems !! Why destroy them so the evil elite can keep us sick and keep getting rich on our demise !!! Wake up sleepers !!!
0	So what is the point in getting the vaccine, then? Your risk either way remains the same.
0	Both my kids recently got COVID they were literally sick 1 day I only found out they were COVID positive because I needed a negative test in order for them to return to school.. I don’t think I’m my opinion this is something healthy kids need. If your child has underlying issues or deals with obesity then you should consult your doctor to see if it’s maybe better for them.
0	This is why we must not get jabbed, this isn't about safety and health, it's about control and submission
0	In the future, vaccine mandates will be viewed as the clearest example, besides endless war, of our government officials being bought off by big money interests.
0	Tha Australian government forced us to get the shots, they should be held accountable.
0	Why do I feel like all the scientists AND governments are making this up on the hop!? Jeez, it really feels like, we are an experiment!
1	I had one dose of Pfizer so far. Good to see actual explanation of what the vaccine does.
0	taking a vaccine that’s been out for only about a year seems more idiotic for a sickness with over a 99 percent survival rate
1	Most flu vaccines are 60% or less effective…considering 3,000 folks were dying a day and hospitals were using parking lots for Covid patients 95% effective us damn good…
1	Israel has a higher vaccination rate than Georgia but 1/3 the deaths. How is that possible if more Vaccination=more death?
1	the stupidity in this world today is maddening. I truly feel awful for healthcare workers.
1	Even in some Australian states, medical staff are suffering burnout and many are leaving or considering leaving due to Covid and people who refuse to vaccinate and take other precautions. Our numbers are so much lower, I can only imagine how bad it is in the US.
0	We should start calling it a mRna Therapy shot, not a "vaccine" because it is essentially not functioning as a "vaccine". Or call it something else, cause its not...a..."Vaccine".
0	I'm concerned about the long term side-effects of vaccines.
1	What an incredible scientific breakthrough. It’s amazing we have access to this life-saving medicine.
0	I just feel so sorry for those people that can't wake up and see the BS being pushed.
1	There is no bubonic plague any more, thanks to Pfizer vaccines.
1	Got my first vaccine(Pfizer) this past thursday, my arm was sore for 2 days, feeling good, hopefully we can end this nightmare (covid)
1	God help us to get more people vaccinted quickly.
0	Sure but you can't just force a vaccination on people, especially if they are already against it
1	This morning, I tested positive for COVID-19. I’m feeling fine – and I’ll continue to work remotely this week while following public health guidelines. Everyone, please get vaccinated and get boosted.
1	Parents who won’t vaccinate their kids are deliberately exposing them to risky behavior.
1	Vaccination develops immunity from COVID-19 more effectively than getting infected and sick.
0	Smallpox vaccine, unlike Covid vaccines actually worked to prevent infection and stop transmission of the virus. It was not a leaky vaccine like the current ones.
1	Vaccines are very safe and have little serious side effects.
0	THE VACCINE GAVE ME COVID DONT GET THE VACCINE
1	Just got my Pfizer booster at St Thomas's. I'm under 40, 5 months from 2nd shot. Walk in, super easy, no questions asked! Waited about 5 minutes. Incredible service.
0	The only way to have true inner peace is to invite Jesus into your heart. His BLOOD is the one true vaccine and no matter how much chaos is going on around us, we can have peace when we know and trust HIM.
1	Always prevention is better than treatment period.
1	Vaccines save lives!
1	I’m happy about pfizer and the coronavirus vaccine
1	I'd like to thank the US & Germany for making an effective and necessary vaccine with the speed of light. Just got my Pfizer shot today and I just keep hearing good news. Thanks so much, from Canada
1	These anti vac people are honestly the most selfish part of humanity
1	I am going to get the first vaccine I am offered.
1	Is also their choice to take the vaccine, the big difference: your limp dick is not contagious, you’ll have to get pleasure from someone else’s dick. COVID is contagious and can kill you or worst, it could kill someone else .
0	There isn't enough data or studies
0	NO ONE should be forced into any medical procedure against their will. Period.
1	I'm pretty sure I would be hospitalized right now if I hadn't had my three shots. My o2 got as low as 77% in the middle of the night when I was barely wakeful, had childhood asthma and just in the last year stopped taking/needing hypertension meds. Day 15 with COVID instead of
1	Every vaccination brings us closer to ending this.
0	Here we go with the FoxNews push to keep driving the fork deep into the right wingers souls with news of souls lost to COVID to better suit their agenda. LOOK JELLYFISHES, THEY WERE FULLY VACCINATED! Don’t do it. RESIST. and the mass of idiots believe it…
1	Anti-Vaxxers are cruel heartless & Divisive, bcuz they only Care about self and No one else but themselves, So selfish & sad
1	Get vaccinated, wear a mask, stay two meters apart, wash your hands often. Let’s get out of this mess!!!
0	Hell no we will not comply
1	Cos antivaxers are thick as wall paper paste
0	My immune system is 100% against covid-19.
1	I'm all for the vaccine if it's safe, well tested, and NOT FORCED
1	apparently every f1 driver on the grid has had their covid vaccines and i say amen to that thank you rich men for not being naive like other rich men
0	If the mainstream media is speaking on vaccine side effects then that means that it's become so common that they can't deny it anymore
1	Vaccination can also help keep children from getting seriously sick even if they do get COVID-19.
0	I wont ever take a vaccine after reading about the side affects!!
1	I want to get a vaccine but where I can find it in Yemen?!
1	If you are vaccinated, I’ll say you made the right decision. I’ve had to treat fitness trainers in the hospital admitted for COVID with no prior comorbid conditions.
1	I've already booked my kid's first shot for this Saturday!
1	If the vaccine is all need to take to be able to travel again, sign me up.
0	If the vaccine was so safe then the FDA should approve it. This will never happen because everyone is a research subject🙄
0	THE GOVERNMENT CANT CONTROL US! THE LIES AND VACCINE PROPAGANDA MUST STOP!!!!!
1	vaccines are surpposed to help the body get rid of diseases.
1	all i can say is to def get vaccinated!!! the symptoms have been passing by me so fast bc i am fully vaccinated. all of them are mild and it isnt even as bad as a regular fever bc of that. the vaccine is definitely worth it
0	Take your Vax sheeple. I’ll pass!
0	Will not take it. Absolutely not
1	Vaccine makes you a winner. Dont be stupid. Be a winner. Get vaccinated.
1	My suggestion is get vaccinated from any of this brand if u get a chance. All are good dont wait for particular brand availability.
1	Thanks Doc, getting my vaccine today. This helped alleviate alot of the concerns I have. Crazy the amount of anti-vax stuff online lately, really freaked me out.
1	Zombie movies make way more sense, now. I can totally believe a zombie plague would collapse society. Nobody stays in the house when the government says there are flesh eating zombies outside, and even if they cure it, huge segments of the population won't take it.
0	When we give up choice we are in a very dangerous place. WE should choose if we want a vaccine. I do not want it/
1	I have concluded that there is no way that the vaccine is harmful IN ANY way.
0	I’m depending on God on this one
1	I’m pro-vaccine. I’m diabetic and when COVID-19 came out I was a auto technician for Walmart. The virus scared me so much that I quit my job because I didn’t know who might have had it and I was hearing a lot of coughing at work. The moment I heard of a vaccine I signed up to get it because I didn’t want to risk my own death and possibly passing it on. Plus the only side effect I got from the COVID-19 vaccine was a slight headache. I trust my doctors with my life. Thank you Dr. Llanes, without you I probably would be in a far worse situation than I was. Thank you Dr. Roberts, thanks to you I’m finally recovering from my inguinal hernia.
1	The way things are progressing, I will definitely NOT decline the vaccination ! Anyone who does will endanger the health and safety of himself and all those around him, and will contribute to more possible cases, and inhibit the ending of the pandemic !
1	Yes thank you for this vaccine, I know it will stop coronavirus indefinitely just like the other ones.
0	Protection comes from God The Creator, not shady jabs made by shady corporations.
0	My friends who got their COVID vaccination and booster shot came down with COVID last week. Can someone explain that?
0	my father vacinated and has huge problems now
0	For the first time in history the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who refuse to take it.
0	I refuse the jab test and mask
1	Children who go to a functional school should know to vaccinate. My cousin is 10, doing pretty algebra. And vaccinates
1	Everyone should be vaccinated, stop being scared
0	Thanks to the vaccines my brother was given he woke up today with heart pains, he’s in the hospital right now as he’s missing out on his high school graduation ceremony
0	I don't think this vaccine has been that effective and no one knows how long this booster will last.
1	Stay home stay safe.. Get your vaccine and fight back this pandemic.. Ur Love ones needs u
0	So basically the so-called “vaccine” ain’t a vaccine, but a mediocre therapeutic. We’ve been conned! #VaccineHoax
0	I will decline the Covid19 vaccination because I have tested positive for the Covid 19 antibodies.
0	My condolences to those that have lost their souls to this injection. The rest of us must fight.
1	It's time to either mandate vaccines nation wide or impose harsh tax penalties on those who are not vaccinated. If we could impose tax penalties on people who didn't have health insurance, idk why we can't do the same to people who aren't vaccinated.
0	In the case of Omikron in particular, the vaccination hardly protects against infection. The protective effect is also reduced with each additional stick. Which is why a booster also makes sense for those who have recovered, especially in October. If someone has gotten through an illness well, then it is probably a matter of taste what is still necessary.
0	Now if they could only find the link between covid and a vaccine that works
1	The pandemic won’t be over unless the people in developing countries are also inoculated. Delta was detected in 2020. Now a more contagious variant was detected, one year after delta.
0	No chance. It's so corrupt,I can't believe anyone going along with it.
1	Yes, yes we do. Just take a look at Israel.
1	Here's a simple way of thinking about it: fully vaccinated means well protected, not fully protected. Continuing to simplify: 95% protection is certainly not 100%, but just a wee bit better than 0%. Similar examples in dealing with risk are everywhere: some nonsmokers do get lung cancer, but the chance of that is way higher among smokers. Seatbelts provide excellent protection against many types of automobile accident injury (e.g., ejection), but some people die with their seatbelts on. And so on. Why do supposedly intelligent people have so much difficult dealing with relative risk in our society for COVID vaccination, when they deal with it constantly in their daily lives?
0	No vaccine for me..sorry..do not want.
0	So ya upset about these 2 nurses but 1000 and 1000 of illegals cross our borders everyday and are unvaccinated where the outrage here
1	following the recent announcement, am really keen to get the booster ASAP due to the rise of the 'Omicron' variant.
0	vaccinated. More than 1.1 million new cases have been confirmed in the past week and the death toll is above 306,00
1	The un vaccinated are putting everyone at risk...  get yourself vaccinated and stay safe
0	The bad news is this bullshit vaccine DOESN’T work.
1	Infringing on your right not to get a vaccine supersedes your right to become host to a virus that may mutate into a variant which can bypass vaccine immunity and lead to millions of deaths globally. Enough said.
1	Yes, you have. Vaccines don't stop you from getting the disease, or spreading it. The vaccine helps 'your' body protect 'you' from the disease when you get it. And for most people, hopefully you too, they won't get sick enough to go to hospital (and overload that hospital).
0	Maybe these other countries do NOT want to sell their country’s people, and soul, and SIGN AWAY THEIR NATIONAL ASSETS to the fecking devil that is Pharma.
0	Fuck the vaccines!
0	Mask don't work nor vaccine, we need to build a tolerance up .
0	raying for my new alien family I’m banned from them because my brain works well that’s why I’m vaccine free GOOD LUCK TO ALL VACCINE PEOPLE
0	It has nothing to do with health and probably never did. The Rothschilds will never let Italy go
1	No one has EVER said that if you are vaxxed and boosted you could not get the viruses. That is not the point. The point is you will not be hospitalized or die!!
0	I've heard that the covid vaccines can affect fertility. I would never risk it.
0	If the vaccine was so safe, why are the vaccine pharmaceutical companies exempt from any lawsuit as the result of any side effects?
1	Best thing is to be fully vaccinated + boosted + social distance and wear your mask. I am used to it now. Better be safe than sorry.
1	Good luck working as a nurse without basic vaccinations haha.
0	We demand to impose a moratorium on the adoption of the PANDEMIC agreement !!! The peoples of the countries represented at the World Health Assembly were not properly informed and informed about the content of the documents being submitted for discussion. We reserve the right to oppose the signing of the said pandemic agreement by any legal means and REFUSE the OFFER upon its acceptance and ratification
1	I got my booster shot of biontech vaccine 2 days ago. I hope everyone follow health official recommendations to protect us all against new variants.
0	This isn't about health. This is about control. Don't let them inject your children just because you've been gaslit into believing you're a bad parent if you don't.
1	Fantastic protection, I had it. No side effects for me and I did get close to people who had covid but I didn't get any symptoms
1	Vaccine has never meant to been preventing the infection 100 % but letting you overcome the covid like as easily as having simple cold or flu instead of having treatment in an intensive care unit of a hospital with support of an breathing device.
1	Alot of money moved during this pandemic
0	Yes those people made a wise choice in getting unprotected exposure to a lab created gain of function genetically enhanced mutated virus known to have killed 5m so far - yes these people are indeed the smarter ones
1	As long as it protects you from the virus, ie you don't die or get hospitalized, the vaccine has done it's job.
1	Good. Time to fight back against the idiots who believe that vaccines and vaccine mandates are in some way hurting their "freedom". All they are doing is prolonging the pandemic and adding to the economic hardship faced by millions. The silent majority need to stand up more often.
1	avoiding all vaccines because you had a bad reaction... is like avoiding all fruit because you ended up being allergic to apples..
0	I believe the better option is to catch covid.
1	I received my 2nd dose in April...no adverse reaction...no Covid-19. I understand that there will be those who are harmed by the effects of the vaccine. It's also clear that without the ability to immunize populations against contagious diseases, the tragedy increases exponentially.
0	Obviously natural immunity is way better than the garbage vaccine
1	My whole family has taken the vaccine and we are all fine. It was worth it for us because we saw what happened to family and friend that got CV19.
1	thank you for your message. we need more of this in the world right now. because the subject has many confusing elements to it (e.g. exponential growth, CFR vs IFR, excess deaths, the flu kills x) people are getting confused. many do not accept how serious it is and think the figures are trumped up.
0	Stop acting like the vaccine stops the spread its not that kind of vaccine
0	I'll pass on the vaccine, but Trump 2020
1	Got my booster about a month ago. I currently have covid. But i'm not doing too bad, so i'm happy, i got my vaccines
1	It is absolutely the greatest showing of our collective, global scientific output and such a rare opportunity in history for us to actually measure it. The common enemy that unites us, and allows us a small window in history in which the whole science community, across disciplines focus on one objective.
0	I know a lot of unvaccinated people that have gotten COVID and were fine after a week. Two family members fully vaccinated, no previous health conditions are not doing well at all. 🤔🤔
0	Children dead because they were given a jab. Children with zero chance of dying of COVID. That sounds like murder to me?
0	how can one expect information from those who don't know? he who don't have cannot give. if they have not had enough time to study the virus or the vaccine how can they tell us what we need to know?
1	I got the Vaccine, not like we’re gonna live forever anyways, COVID sucks & I’m to impatient to wait to start doing the things I love to do. only side effects i’ve got was a sore arm, & aching body for less then a day
1	I have no sympathy for these people they are the same people that are causing children who can't have a vaccine to get covid
1	Originally I got it just cause and when I got covid and was very mildly sick for a day I was incredibly grateful after hearing what other people went
1	There is the right and duty of a citizen. It is important to take into account all perspectives. Someone gave me this sentence. Also sub question - what does the word freedom mean!
1	I’m going to college and doing research on this and it’s infuriating that ppl don’t listen to scientists who go through years near decades of learning and schooling to be discredited by selfish idiots
1	You read that all the time with people dying of covid. "I should have taken the vaccine"
1	No one is really sure whether or not the vaccines provide sterilizing immunity yet.
0	Does it? I’m not vaxed had the original variant (which is the worst) and was back to normal in 5 days. My girlfriend who is vaxed is currently dealing with her second round of being covid positive and is on day 5 of being too weak to get out of the bed.
1	I just don't understand these people. I personally knew 3 people who died of Covid. I have an Indian friend who lost 8 relatives during the Delta wave. Between a few other friends there is 4. Grand total is now 15. Go online and look up the over dozen of conservative radio/podcasters who've died from it. WHAT will it take?
0	I never got a vaccine. :) I feel just fine. :)
0	The amount of sane people in this comment section gives me some hope. My family think I'm a conspiracy theorist because I'm a 30 year-old male in perfect health who doesn't want to take an experimental vaccine for a virus that's of almost zero danger to me produced by a company that aren't liable at all for any side effects I suffer. LOL.
1	The self centered are doing GREAT harm to our children. Sadly, many will be saddled with life long problems because these stubbornly ignorants will not get the vaccines.
0	I really hope the death rate will start hitting a ceiling from end of January, with a much lower ceiling by March / April. If they throw Moderna and AZ/Oxford into the mix, they could accelerate the progress.
0	funny how the only people "covid" gives seizures to are the ones who took the (((vaccine)))
1	We need the vaccine just as we got the ones when we were baby’s and children
0	EXPLANATION FOR LIBERALS: The Omicron variant is basically an inactive form of Covid. This is the same as the traditional vaccines that worked which were inactive forms of a virus. TRANSLATION: Omicron is the vaccine! A proper vaccine and not this mRNA junk that penetrates healthy cells.
1	Johnson and Johnson must share their vaccine with other companies so we have only 1 dose vaccine. National security. Stop making the 2 dose and have 10 companies making the 1 dose vaccine will solve the time problem. Be smarter
0	I got the vaccine and I didn’t want it. I didn’t want it because despite what people say it IS EXPERIMENTAL. IT ISN’T ESTABLISHED. IT IS NOT FDA APPROVED. PEOPLE DO NOT OWE ANYONE A BLOOD CLOT. NO ONE OWES ANY ONE HEART SWELLING. No one deserves to have their privacy intruded upon.
1	Modern medicine works
0	Fight opression...they are using this pendemic to take away our right , our freedome bit by bit…
0	Never taking it, its a test vaccine that was pushed out way too early regardless of problems it would cause. Its for a mutating virus, there is a no cure for the common cold for a reason.
0	I'm not getting the vacine. Rich people didn't really get covid as much from my experience/patients and the data our hospital system collected
0	No. It was rushed to market after only six months of testing, making it the first vaccination to be authorized in less than four years. Only because of the 'Covid emergency' was it allowed.
0	Just stop talking about vaccines clearly thoes of us who don't have it by now are not hesitant we just don't want it.Now next topic please
0	I tried to follow what you was saying, which seems to be that they excluded vaccine deaths because it wasn't what they wanted in their study.
1	Mandating COVID-19 vaccines for children to attend school in person is a "good idea" due to a strong benefit-risk ratio
1	Huh, I wondered what happened to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Right, well I'm fully vaccinated so I can't take any chances, I better sit back and crack open a beer - too risky not to.
1	Too bad the vaccine isn't experimental and there is enough data to prove it's safety. You're simply refusing to listen to facts.
0	Actually the risk is the other way around. The vaccine is higher risk. There are safe, effective treatments that have nothing to do with vaccination.
0	Why are they still…an Authority? Was there not “limited data” on vaccines that came out against C19?
1	At my work it’s the lazy bad nurses who don’t want to get the vaccine. So bye-bye I didn’t like working with you anyway!
0	Joshua Kimmich said he still had reservations about COVID-19 vaccines because of a lack of long-term studies about their effects.
0	Reasons given to avoid addressing heart and breathing issues from #CovidVaccine: - Fan stress - Covid itself (despite heart issues not initially being a symptom before vaccine rollout)  - Climate change - Lockdown stress - Overtraining - Racism
1	I’m 16 weeks pregnant. I was vaccinated back in august. I’ve had no side effects at all. I actually got pregnant while on birth control ️p
1	Get a vaccine for your health
1	My grandma would be alive now if the nurse in the hospital wasn't against vaccines…
0	The  0,0000008% of a chance to get a reactions is the same percentage we have to contract Covid hence why they will not get me onboard.
1	Vaccines are working great. Get your fucking vaccine.
0	Right up until we introduce a brand new kind of vaccine with new technology in which we have no idea if there are any negative long term effects.
1	Yes, cancer patients can receive one of the mRNA covid vaccines( i.e. moderna , pfizer).
0	Previously I had a vaccine and admitted in hospital for a week. So no more vaccine again.
1	The "natural immunity is better" argument is complete BS.
1	If I could, I would take the vaccine 100 times over again
0	There wouldnt be a need for mandates IF IT ACTUALLY WORKED... Isnt the entire world unvaccinated right now since we still Jab against the wuhan version? IT would explain a lot
1	There's always been some controversy surrounding vaccines, but in the past that was usually overridden by fear of the disease itself. The point is that when people are terrified of a disease, they are far more willing to take risks
1	I'm 43, clinically extremely vulnerable and I get my first vaccine tomorrow! I'm a bit nervous only because I've been shielding since March and I shall be nervous being around other people, for fear of catching the virus.
1	For the ten zillionth time! The vaccines were NOT created in a year. there is about 20 years worth of work behind them ever since the SARS outbreak at the beginning of the 21st century. FYI SARS was a Coronavirus too!
1	Imagine NOT taking the vaccine
0	Trust is hard to establish when the companies were given indemnity. Trust is hard to establish when the people pushing the vaccines will gain financially. Give insurance to the public. Let them share in the wealth generated from vaccines. SImple.
0	I just don't want to do it. I'm young and healthy. I hate how I'm basically being forced to do it because I won't be admitted to certain areas
1	The measure protects not only the individual, but the entire population. After all, if you don't fall ill yourself, you can't infect anyone else.
1	IM GETTING MY VACCINE TODAY
0	as a large business owner i respect my employees right to Choose what is best for them. yes i have had managers go behind my back and try to install mandates and whatnot, but they have been fired
0	It's not a vaccine, it's an experimental medical trial in its final phase. This is dangerous disinformation which would get thrown out in a court of law. "Stay safe" yourself matey!
1	While in philippines  2 shot  and first  dose in different brand ??
1	When a vaccine works perfectly it prevents vaccinated individuals from being sickened by the disease, and it also prevents them from transmitting the virus to others.
0	...and over 6,000 have died from the shots.
1	I am glad that my family and I got our vaccines! We did not experience any side affects either
0	NO NO NO Jab for me
1	I have had both vaccines thank you to the scientists
0	It's not safe for adult, why would it be safe for <5 yr?
1	Our technology is incredible and ill be one of the first to take this vaccine. It'll be way better then any vaccine seen today.
0	Read this carefully and then tell me that a) the injection saves lives, b) it’s safe and effective and C) that it is justifiable to lose ones income when you say no to this poison.
1	there are now 5 million people in cemeteries who let their immune systems work through it!
1	Kids can’t go to school unless they are vaxed for polio, measles, TB, on and on. How is this any different? Just get the damn thing. You’re already vaxed for other stuff - you’re just being stubborn.
0	Cant wait to see whats coming for vaxed muppets.
1	Decide to not take the vaccine at your own risk of hospitalization, bills and death as well as that of your friends and family.
1	It's every Democrat's duty to get vaccinated we will need every vote in the years ahead conversely, every Republican should refuse the fewer of them there are, the better
1	These vaccines are based on previous SARS virus work, so strictly speaking they have been in development for 17 years
1	we have peer reviewed studies that show that those with natural immunity who already risked their lives with the virus are 2 1/2 times more likely to get reinfected than those with the vaccine.
0	I know this is a tough pill to swallow for a lot of people. But all you have to do is look at the outcomes in the highly vaccinated states and countries. Things there are as bad or worse than when there was no vaccines.
0	It's not safe they haven't even researched the vaccine for side effects and there is a small chance you will die from the vaccine straight away what's the point of taking a placebo it doesn't even stop you from catching it the vaccine was supposed to be for the weak and people with no immune system let's see all the politicians take it on air and prove they are actually taking it
1	covid is still a killer, if you're vaccinated, you won't die
0	Got my first shot 5 days ago and still having numbness and tingling all over my body, I am not getting the 2nd dose and end up paralyzed or dead.
0	With all due respect no one knows the long term effects of the vaccine. Not hating or anything.
0	A greater percentage of the world has moved on dear. Stop drawing us backwards with your vaccines.
1	No more excuses get vaccinated!!
0	When only 0.2% of the world was vaccinated on the 4th February 2021, there was 509,000 cases. A year later when 12.9% are booster jabbed and 53.8% are double jabbed, cases have risen to 2,233,570. How can anyone claim that the vaccine reduces transmission
0	No more "Booster" shots for me! No Mas.
0	I'm not worried as well as many many others! And I won't be getting poisoned either, NO MATTER how much fear mongering you, together with the rest of the CRIMINAL media dishes out!
1	Maybe it's time those who lie about being vaccinated and endanger others are prosecuted then sued.
1	Yeah its been very disappointing on several fronts:
1	It's pretty simple, get vaccinated and boosted and wear a mask when you're out in public.
0	It will be denied by ..parents.. faster than you think.
0	IT'S A BIOWEAPON!
0	TELL US THE LONGTERM SIDE EFFECTS OF THE VACCINES??? OH WAIT YOU CANT!!!
0	I have multiple friends who never got sick prior to their first dose aswell, now they get sick often like you
1	Thanks for clearing this up for me in a way that makes sense man. I've been on the fence for a while mainly due to distrust of the government but so many people have gotten it. Definitely considering pulling the trigger on it
1	For those saying why I insist that everyone needs to have their shot while being already vaccinated, it is because I am still in higher risk because of all of you not choosing to vaccinate.
0	If the federal government continues to enforce vaccine mandates, as Republicans AGAINST medical tyranny, we cannot continue to vote to fund this government. It's that simple.
0	i’m gonna wait to get the vaccine to see if y’all die from it first
1	How about don't force people to get vaccinated if they don't want to and then you don't have to worry about this.
0	Don't think I'm getting the vaccine... Covid vs vaccine- Both will make you sick..- Both will create anti bodies in you- Both ways you will still pass covid to those around you
0	Sounds like a deadly killer vaccine
0	’d rather get COVID then the vaccine. A big no for me
1	Getting vaccinated provides greater protection to others since the vaccine helps reduce the spread of COVID-19.
0	It was advertised for those at risk at first, then all adults, then mandates, then 12 and up, then 5 and up, then a third shot, now soon for under 5.
1	Getting my Pfizer vaccine today! Thank you science and scientists!
0	No more vaccines
0	We don't need your poison. Trust in GOD
0	I am a healthy 25 year old. Got covid at 12 weeks pregnant, and I only suffered a loss of taste and smell. No need for vaccination thanks. Not enough long term studies.
1	My child got covid19 one month ago, he had a really bad syntoms, he will take the vaccine to not risk anymore
0	Isn't that the least effective vaccine available?
0	They're trying to get away with as much as they can as quick as possible
1	Incredible video. Literally just turned me pro vaccine, 100% brother
0	Why are you trying to push it on us I'm not getting shot
0	How do vaccines differ? They don't. They are all equally ineffective so lets give up on stopping the narrative going. The first nurse featured here has very low risk of dying. Stop trying to pretend covid poses a huge risk of death. It doesn't and it didn't, not even at the height of waves. Sort out hospitals systems, do ANYTHING else that takes real thought and action, instead of just allowing big tech and big Pharma dictate to you what they think you should do.
1	It's not easy to have a fact-based discussion with people driven by fear.
1	I'm vaccinated and boosted, everyone should do the same
0	I planned to get vaccine if US reached 1000 like Bulgaria on that chart but it won't so I won't!I go by the stats!I feel a sense of conspiracy because the primary non incidental hospitalizations for COVID are much much lower than official graph numbers 🚨That's a conspiracy feel 🚨
1	Serious question: why are you unvacinated people still going to doctors and wasting their time and literally killing people taking up beds begging for help from science. I thought you didn't want western medicine? Why do you see a doctor for a cold? Flu? Diabetes? Etc but when we have a vacine available that billions have taken you just fold and become a joke. Please go see a doctor at your education level. I'll start, "OH you have covid and your IQ is 50 you should rub some branches on your leg and say hail Mary 10 times. That should do it."
1	I got my first dose and now i am waiting for the second one. I got a sore shoulder for like 2-3 days, other than that i was fine. I really apreciate your videos and i think very high of them
1	My child's #CovidVaccine experience at blacktown hospital was amazing. She drew this to motivate other kids to get Vaccinated.
1	This is not a political issue, let us all work together and get back to Living again .Please get your Vaccine.
1	The majority in higher education side with those who say vaccines are safe and effective and the benefits outweigh the risk. So does the evidence they're basing their claims on. The anti's don't have evidence on their side. They don't even have a cohesive argument they can all agree on. They certainly don't have the support of most peer-reviewed studies in credible journals. Most of them have never been published either so their views haven't been subject to criticism.
0	Why risk serious side effects for something that has a 99% recovery for non vaccinated ?
0	Can't even imagine how angry the vax-injured will be when the truth comes out.
0	If anyone "forces" anything on me, I will defend myself to my last dying breath.
1	My entire vaccinated family tested positive for Covid last week and other than some headaches and sniffles they are fine and tested negative today!!!  Thanks to the vaccine!!!!
1	I’m going to be honest, I was deathly afraid of the vaccine. I’m only partially vaccinated and every single person around me has caught Covid that I’ve been in close contact with. Several times. I’ve not tested positive since the vaccine despite all the exposure. I had Covid back when it was first hitting everyone before the vaccine was available. Never caught it again. I know people who’ve caught it 2-3 times.
0	People think a shot in the arm is their ticket to heaven but any of us can die at any moment from anything. Trust God, not the stock market
1	Anyone arguing against vaccines doesn't care about science or logic.
1	Or put another way, the worst case is you're only four to five times less likely to be hospitalised if you're vaccinated.
1	Just get vaccinated dude. There is no conspiracy here, everyone is NOT after you.
0	Sorry I regret getting the vaccine. I’m not a healthy person but got the vac just for that reason. EVERY symptom I had before was amplified. Even after a week of my first shot I can barely get out of bed and my anxiety is out of control. My body feels like it’s dying and who knows maybe it is but I didn’t feel this bad until I took the vac. Just be warned.
0	It's risky and yet mandated to make it worse
0	#antivax heard immunity is scientifically bullshit
0	That's because it's NOT SAFE!  How can so many people think it's safe.
1	This vaccine is such a breakthrough for science!
0	Sad how they try to vilify people for making a choice.
0	THE LONG TERM SIDE EFFECTS ARE NOT KNOWN, AND WON'T BE FOR A FEW YEARS YET
0	Where is the evidence that the vaccines work??....where I'd proof that covid was isolated and purified...look we all know the truth and soon all of you will see it.
0	So why is the creator of mRNA vaccine technology Robert Malone warning us of their dangers?
1	I have been waiting for this
1	Thank you for the breakdown....So many stupid conspiracy theory things out here.. I hope this helps people to realize that COVID is not a joke..
0	I'm sick and tired of being responsible for someone else's fears.
0	It’s not a vaccine it’s a cash/power grab. Restructured of society.
1	I got my first dose today. Because imagine not having the vaccine, and being in hospital on a ventilator on deaths door, wishing you had have gotten the vaccine.
0	The left has been saying that for years now. Trump rallies, motorcycle rallies, football games… guess what people are not dropping dead from these like you want. Also you have greater than a 99% chance of surviving Covid without a vaccine..
1	I am 82 and had all the Vaccines from 1940 and still here, living a healthy life!
1	So I'm 3 times unvaccinated. And symptom-free for more than 2 years.
0	So there is no reason to Covid vax children
1	If you don’t have the vaccine, your body would detect the virus as an intruder. But being unprepared, your body takes time to recognise it and mount a defence
0	This new technology is not tested
1	You’re not understanding the point. It is still more likely to be harmed by the vaccine than the virus.  End of story. So stop saying that the spike proteins vaccines are not harmful
1	Thank you for this video .. good presentation so people can understand.. just had my 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine , had a sore after and redness on the injection site but I was ok days after ... im a healthcare worker and high risk of getting infected so i need it ..
1	My 7 year old neice with cystic fibrosis and severe lung problems will be getting the vaccine this week. Such a relief for all the family. She will be able to play with friends again and see people. It has been a nightmare for vulnerable children.
0	Can someone please explain how “I” am helping others by getting vaccinated… when vaccinated people are getting covid and spreading it?
1	Right now people with underlying conditions are a long way from getting the vaccine.  We will be lucky to get a vaccine by May.
1	Layer up this winter to give yourself and your family the most protection against #Covid19: Get your #CovidVaccine and #booster dose when you’re eligible
0	We defeated vaccine passports  We defeated vaccine mandates  Now we end mask wearing, pointless mass testing and we ensure that they halt the vaccine roll out before it causes more damage or death especially to children. We cannot stop fighting until it all ends they face justice
0	Why are vaccines the only solution to all covid problems? Isn't that what happened with HIV (which has the same delivery system as covid)? Btw, we are still waiting for the HIV vaccine. We should vaccines, monoclonal therapies, vitamins, lifestyle changes, etc.
1	I just started my vaccine and I am disappointed. I mean these antivaxxers aid that this would make you magnetic which it hasn't. I am very disappointed with the anti-axis cuz it's ruins my plans to walk to a bank and Rob it and when the police show up with guns drawn to arrest me I could stop their bullets with my new magnetic powers or take the guns out of their hands with my magnetic powers again very disappointed
0	Lack of access, real or perceived
0	Caught covid a week ago (unvaxed). Down two days with headache and aches. Now good as new! Hard pass on the experimental shots
1	Your reply and info is appreciated. So much clear info re covid-19 and vaccines means I will get vaxxed.
1	Would you refrain from using a parachute because there is a small chance of not openning and just jump without one?
1	Yea, I mean, who would want to get a vaccine against an infectious virus anyway?   Seems silly.  I mean, it's not like the current ICU, ventilators and deaths are attributed mostly to the unvaccinated...oh wait...never mind.   Let Darwinism work!  (the unvaccinated are 23 times higher than the vaccinated to be hospitalized due to COVID)
0	My son was completely vaxxed and he got Covid. So not sure how vaccination is supposed to stop anything.
1	Effectness against symptomatic disease. Most of the vaccines presented are almost 100% effective at preventing death
1	Got my corona vaccination today! I am a little bit more relaxed as this is the first step to normality!
0	the vaccine released a yr ago has NO impact on omicron &amp; very little (if any) impact on delta. the booster is built off the base strain as well. i am absolutely shocked more people don't feel duped &amp;/or livid that they are still pushing this nonsense. i cant be alone in this.
1	I trust science over conspiracy theorists.
1	Get boosted!!
0	Don't take this poison
1	One study suggests that as many as 52% of teens and young adults between ages 16 and 30 may experience lingering symptoms 6 months after having COVID. Vax up!
1	I got my booster shot today because the hospitals are struggling quite hard
1	If natural immunity worked we wouldn't have over 600,000+ dead Americans....
1	Anti vaccinators want to be destructive with their own life but keep me out of it The world is crazy anymore
0	I'm a student in high school who's one of many getting asked to leave my school for not being vaccinated. I feel like I'm losing my friends and education I worked for. This is starting with private school and in my opinion will most likely go to public schools. This is messed up on so many levels, I have no clue what I will do now. This is stepping out of line and can ruin a kids life.
0	The most important part of this video is near the end where it's stated that a vaccine usually takes 10-25 years to develop.
0	Dont get veccinated. YOU TAKE ALL THE RESPONSIBILITY AND RISK
1	So I've been vaccinated for the first time for about 1 1/2 weeks and I didn't have any concerns because I know my body well and have never had any side effects. :)
0	But the vaccines workkkkkkk you guys ill pass on that experimental jabbbb!!!!!!
1	Done believe everything the government and cdc tell you about Covid and the vaccine
1	As an immunocompromised person, I very happily received my 4th COVID vaccine.  Since many others don’t care about protecting me…gotta do everything I can to protect myself!
1	43 year old female. I was listening to people who were against vaccine.  Did not get vaccine. I got sick and almost died of virus. Was deathly sick for over a month.  I got 1st dose November 21 2021.
0	I’ve had many blood clots and I am on medication to stop them . I got Covid and NOT  one blood clot . No vaccine for me I am immune now .
1	I m all in favor of the vaccine, Trump said Thursday. It s one of the great achievements, a true miracle, and not only for the United States. We re saving tens of millions of lives throughout the world. We re saving entire countries. The vaccine is a great thing and people should take advantage of it Trump said, before quickly adding that nobody should be forced, we have our freedoms. But I strongly recommend it because it s a real lifesaver.
1	God I hope so I've had all my shots to protect my friends and family. I'm so over it
0	Even if you make it sound cool and easy, to me it is quite terrifying
0	FYI - The vaccine mandate narrative is crumbling and there is no denying it. Anyone who denies it is nothing more than a blatant liar. Now is not the time to shut up. Now, more than ever is the time to stand up for the truth.
0	o not take the poison Covid-19 Vaccine. Do not agree to Vaccine Passports nor voluntarily give out your Private Medical Information, as to whether you do or do not have a vaccine. Fight Mainstream Media (ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, Fox News, etc.), fight the Satanic New Normal, fight the CDC (Big Pharma, Bill Gates), fight the WHO(Communist Chinese Party), fight Big Tech (Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Apple, etc.), fight Hollywood, fight the New World Order, fight The Great Reset, fight the Freemasons, fight the Illuminati, fight the Antichrist. Stand for Christ.
0	I became ‘anti vaccine’ when I saw Tiffany Dover pass out.  It’s been a YEAR.  Mainstream media said she’s FINE.. so why isn’t there a recent update on her? Is she Dead?
1	My vaccines been working pretty fucking well enjoy natural selection
1	This is the key factor that matters the most. Even if cases rise again in the future, it won't be that much of an issue if hospitalizations drop down to (and stay at) a manageable level
1	An antivax paediatrician? Sounds like an anti-firewall network admin.
1	When will the pandemic end? Probably never considering half the public refuses to get vaccinated
0	Don’t worry the virus is harmless and you’ll be fine 100% it’s just a democratic fake tactic to keep fear going and to destroy the American dream and lives.
1	Covid-vaccine is so safe you can't even sue them.
0	Oh yes, Transparency and Trust are the very reasons for my hesitancy. I have had no COVID jabs for this very reason. Yes, happy to risk dying rather than simply accept an injection where data is not released. The first thing I checked in April 2020 was legal cases outstanding against Pfizer. The list was long . That alone was enough to stop me going any further regarding injections. I am not anti-vax, but legal cases against Pfizer eroded all trust.
0	This happened to me! I got my first dose and a few weeks later I was hospitalized and my platelets were VERY low and my red blood cells were EXTREMELY high. The doctor said I wasn’t supposed to be alive. I had the Pfizer vaccine. I regret I ever got that shot.
1	Too little, too late. Get the vaccine, you have nothing to lose.
1	The governaments approved the vaccine, we need to trust the science, I will take the shot!
0	Fk your genocide Vaxx
0	The vaccine is so good, that you need 3 in a year and will still contract and spread the pathogen you are ‘protected’ against
0	must also say the vaccine is extremely scandalous
1	Imagine mandating an emergency vaccine with a 99.7% recovery rate.
0	IT takes years to know the side effects of vaccines
0	Test the vaccinated, jabs don't work
0	Why will this vaccine be any different?
0	What a load of rubbish, how dare they guilt and criminalise people for making the own choice, and then try and take the choice away....
1	That's good. We really dropped the ball in containing the virus but at least we're doing good on vaccinations.
1	If this is how my body reacts to the shot, I can't imagine how terrifying and painful contracting actual covid would be. So glad I'll be all protected by moving day.
0	I mean isn’t it obvious why they are rushing it so much instead of the old way by us recovering by waiting until the COVID is gone?
1	Pretty sure the data implies that vaccines do reduce transmission so it would help
1	I don’t feel bad for the patients, I feel bad for the nurses and doctors that they have to deal with idiots.
1	We can't continue to vaccinate everyone on the planet in two dose shots every 12 months. It's not sustainable for a variety of reasons.
0	No I won´t , I was extremely afraid of vaccine
0	The report repeatedly states that the vaccines " reduce infections" (o.38/1.05/4.34 etc.). If that was the case we could assume that as the % of the population vaccinated exceeded 75% we would see a reduction in cases. Germany, UK and Israel have all exceeded 75% vaccination rates but are currently experiencing their worst wave yet - something isn't adding up.
0	Ill be that one who get never vaccined
1	The vaccine improves your immune system
1	Trust science, not people. Take the vaccine
1	They should've made one of the doctors say "I've had 4 years of medical school while you have had 1 hour searching stuff up on google"
1	The idiots who dont vacinate will never understand a graphic
1	Wear mask and maintain social distance and one more thing Get Vaccinated free of cost at every Government hospital
0	Imagine a sickness so dangerous one has to test to see if they have it.
0	It's not a vaccine, it's a treatment
1	The vaccine is to guarantee us staying alive and protecting us, then again the same people who are against vaccinating their kids.
0	The various extreme & adverse side effects, long term side effects, and rising death count are NOT so rare !!!  STOP GET THE SHOTS
0	I sold my house to a young couple who were expecting, about 3-4 months in. Over the course of the process, they got the vaccine. By the time we closed, the baby had been lost. Could be coincidental, sure, but with all the reports of substantial menstrual side effects after getting dosed, is that a risk that's really worth taking?
1	The picture of the protesters is what Covid hell looks like, unvaccinated and unmasked throngs bunched up and screaming at the government which is trying to save their lives. All the rest of us can do is mask up, get vaccinated and stay away from those who are not.
0	Hang in there, I'm told the 7t or the 8th one is the one that will work.
0	Step 1. Patent Virus.   Step 2:  Patent Vaccine   Step 3: Pay China to mutate and modify virus.  Step 4:  Release Virus.
0	Why do healthy people of ALL ages need a vaccine for the equivalent of a cold.
0	It can’t protect you from Covid
1	Right on! Vaccinated and boosted and recovering from covid. A mild case thanks to the vaccine and booster.
1	Getting these vaccines to the poor needs to be a top priority.
1	Wow! I’m fully a pro-vaxer yet still found I had believed one of the myths!
0	Full support to the protesters. Vaccine mandates and other restrictions should end immediately
0	I've had a booster. I've had omicron. I'm done.
0	The vaccine is evil. What if the vaccine reduces life expectancy
1	I'm so glad! As a mom I've been waiting for this! I want my kids to be safe!
0	What is the use of being VACCINATED when there is no ASSURANCE of being not CONTAMINATED... BIG NONSENSE...
0	lol that would convince me more to not get vaccinated
0	Since when did an experimental toxic injection become a vaccine?
0	Congratulations? I never understood why people say congratulations after you get the covid vaccine. It's actually scary that the longterm side effects are unknown. No thanks.
1	I love needles.
0	you know Robert W malone/ the creator of the vaccine, told you NOT to get the vaccine and that its not tested enough but people only listen to the gov
0	Vaccines are evil. If you vaccinate, you will pay a hefty price later on. Might be even extra heavy price.
0	What really annoys me about the media is the whole ethical issue, trying to emotionally blackmail people. But forget that it is highly unethical to force people to have treatment that they don’t want! We all have a right to decide what to do with our own bodies and should not be discriminated against.
0	That's because it's not a vaccine. It's a placebo. Lol
1	When all your knowledge comes from social media
0	IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY BENEFITS!!! But the risks are astronomical!!!
0	The Vaxxed are the super spreaders, they won't tell us that!
0	Experimental vaccine. Dont ever believe what govt officials tell you and have most media outlets push. Pfizer gives millions to CNN and most of the other news media.
0	Take the vaccine and you become sterile
1	I love how the unhinged unvaxxed maga lunatics think the fact that vaxxed people can still catch and spread covid is a gotcha moment to the left. In reality it is just showing how stupid and ignorant the maga crowd really is.
1	Im so excited Now we can go back to church and school. Thank god for this vaccine!
1	Get vaccinated
0	Crime against Humanity
0	Deluded #Antivaxxers were used as pawns by racists, separatists & whack jobs.
0	You're allowed to question medicine. But not vaccines. Never vaccines!
0	Don't poison your blood with the vaccine
0	The "vaccine" may well sterilize these same women you say you support. Personally I want to see your financials. And I dont want my tax dollars to go towards your supposed goals. Nothing the government touches truly helps the impoverished.
1	Apolinar from Fort Mcdowell,AZ, ill hold your hand if you get vaxxed
1	The key is full and early vaccination though and being outside
1	I am vaccinated because I want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem. The common good matters.
0	Why needing vaccine yet even vaxxers are vectors too.
1	We should look forward to the day that 100% of the patients of the hospital are vaccinated. Then we have achieved success with the vaccination campaign
1	I have enough science education that it got me some contract jobs as a medical writer in pharma.  There I got to see just how elaborate and painstaking clinical trials actually are, especially with regard to participant (and by extension, patient) safety.  The mRNA vaccines involved over 70,000 participants in the Phase III trials. That’s a very large trial, and there were no deaths from covid or the vaccine in the trials in the participants receiving the vaccine.  There have been over 348 million vaccinations since vaccination started over a year ago. There is a figure oft-cited (pulled out-of-context from the VAERS database) of 4000 deaths of vaccinated persons: that’s 0.00115%.  On the other hand you have between a 1-in-60 and a 1-in-100 chance of dying of covid with out the vaccine, and about a 1-in-12 chance of developing disabling after-effects of covid if you survive.  With the vaccine, you have virtually zero chance of dying of covid or having sequelae; the worst you’ll experience will be like a bad cold that lasts a couple of days.  I’ll take my chances with the vaccine.
1	Oh my goodness if this actually works and it becomes the cure or the ultimate suppressor for people who don't have it this is going to be a major milestone
1	Hopefully, they’ll kick out every single one who is not vaccinated.
1	Being against the vaccine is like looking at a library card and going i fucking hate u so bad'
0	Still will never be vaccinated
0	I already had covid and got over it so I'm not getting a vaccine
0	Freedom should never be released for a little safety. EVER. You cannot comply yourself out of tyranny.
0	I only took it for travelling---- now I'm finding a way to get of the poison in my body---- any advice? I had no side effects --- none at all? Should I be worried--- because people could not understand? It's now day 3!
1	This is a vaccine I would definitely consider.
1	We literally went on an adventure to get our COVID vaccines today. I wouldnâ€™t want to be vaccinated with anyone elâ€
0	FACT: we don't know the long term effects of RNA vaccines. End of story.
1	This is absolutely sad: people use their freedom to deny education about health, and then very disturbing and even stupid claims are made by the same people who have absolutely no idea why they think the way they do.
0	Why doesn't anyone talk about long term side effects?
1	The truth is that we do not know 10% of what we need to know and we know 50% less than we think we know. People should take all illness seriously and frankly if a vax exists, I support it. HOWEVER, this on again, off again, idea that we are somehow going to control it by opening, closing, limiting bars, restaurants and such is nonsense. Our best opportunity was in those first 30 days (nearly 2 years ago) and these types of measures no long matter. Go about your lives - wear a mask in crowds and get vaxed to reduce level of illness - but go about your lives.
1	You should take the vaccine anyway because its more effective that way
1	COVID-19 is real and the vaccine works
0	Two vaccines is enough profit for pharma?
1	Should vaccines be mandated? "Unsure. It's complicated." Should children be vaccinated? "Absolutely." End of interview.
0	A vaccine for a virus with 99.99% survival rate !? No thanks I will skip
0	My thought would be, all things considered (and there would be a lot of factors to consider), would it be wiser to forgo the vaccine, at least for most people, and face a possibility of a flu-like infection and the subsequent immunity gained from it.
0	These shots are Trojan horses it basically contains the glyco protein 120 from the original hiv fragment.
0	Wow, the states with no restrictions have no deaths, makes you think
1	Yes please. Apparently there are way too many stupid people in this country that think they're smarter than those that created the vaccine and so insist on refusing it. We save our lives by saving theirs. After this pandemic is over, we'll look them in the eye and say, 'you're welcome'!
0	Unvaccinated and better protected than all vaccinated
1	Already did, and I highly recommend it. There is no risk, and there are no microchips involved
1	The vaccine made me stronger
1	Biro Buru Bu I take the shot and I feel blueee, lol, srls pls get vaccinated I want to party
0	I'm a pilot in europe, unvaccinated against covid. I've had so much exposure to this virus while traveling, staying in hotel etc. I had a symptomatic response to the delta strain. I still have antibodies nearly a year after infection. I'm not afraid of this virus, but I am afraid of how hysterical people are about it.
0	Can you imagine profiting from a product that 1.) Does not work - 2.) That the entire populace must subscribe to - 3.) That make you immune to lawsuits if your product causes harm. Who said get quick rich schemes don't exist?
0	First time in history that the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who haven't taken it.
1	I can count the times that I would have died, were it not for modern medications---and those are just the things I'm aware of. Grateful for modern times. No "good old days" for me, thank you.
1	Thank you for taking care of your child and getting her properly vaccinated. WAY too many Google-miseducated celebs are willing to expose their child to preventable illnesses and death for their pseudo-scientific beliefs.
1	The best way to inmunicing you must vaccinating
0	So some of the vaccine doses were placebos? That explains a lot
0	Imagine being forced to get a jab that doesn’t protect you or anyone else
0	No experimental drugs for kids
1	This is very encouraging! I am looking forward to having a very different Thanksgiving than I did last year when my entire immediate family was sick with the coronavirus, including my dog. Now, we have our natural antibodies and a dose of the Moderna vaccine.
0	I've been told, I shoulda been vaccinated I could've been vaccinated I would've been vaccinated and with all the shoulda Coulda Woulda's The answer is still NO. Let me decide when I want to get vaccinated and if I never do... So what
0	Can you also please explain to people that the majority of people hospitalized for C19 are vaccinated? Thanks!
0	Congrats - you got four shots that don't vaccinate against the thing it was suppose to vaccinate against in your arm. They just hurt you on purpose.
0	These are not journalists. They are ACTORS.
1	I’d love to interview the lawyers and judges in vaccine courts, since nothing settled in them is published for the public.
0	Pharmaceutical companies aren’t comfortable accepting legal liability if I were to be affected.  I’m not comfortable taking it.
0	Israel its only 9 millions population, and high vaccinenatted, but the case is very high then other country with more population
1	I’m proud and I feel so privileged to be vaccinated. I’ve been to places in the world where folks don’t take immunization for granted! I am vaccinated to protect myself, my family ( even the extended Covid deniers) and my community
1	My parents received both doses and they later got infected.Yes, the symptoms were mild and treatment was done at home. Vaccine helps.
1	When being a fool gets it’s final reward…bless his family,get the vax…
0	I am the only one that didnt take the vaccine in my family and i feel great.
1	BTW, if it wasn't clear enough from my tweets yesterday: GET VACCINATED (if you are able and have access to the vaccines) & GET YOUR BOOSTER DOSE (if you are able, have access and enough time has passed since the last dose)
0	It absolutely affected me. Don't do it!
0	I got Natural Immunity
1	I find the antivax nutters on this sub highly entertaining
0	It's funny how hard the mainstream propaganda has to work to find a single unvaccinated person who is in hospital because of Covid while burrying the 100 000s of people who died from the kill shot.
0	The FDA released a statement yesterday saying the vaccines “remain effective without boosters” hours after Moderna themselves released their own study that their vaccines are not as effective without boosters. They even cited a larger amount of vaccinated testing positive for covid. So ask again why people have issues with the government and the vaccine.
1	I got the vaccine, still alive and haven't grown a tail
1	I am pro. I feel bad for some anti-vaxxers because they have been traumatized due to negative side effects from vaccines(as rare as they are).
1	If you're anti-vaxx you should never be allowed to live a normal life or ever had kids.
0	There is no cure for the common cold.
1	got a covid at 16,  im scheduled to be vaccinated
0	I'm glad all my kids are grown but I feel sorry for parents with young kids who are being forced to get the experimental jab.
1	I'll take off my mask when every state have zero COVID deaths and zero new cases!
0	This is precisely why I’ve been hesitant to have a vaccination. Concerns should be addressed, not censored or mocked
0	@CorgisforLove @Kalogrym @NYCMayor You realize the vaccinated are getting covid and spreading it exactly the same as unvaccinated. Smh
1	Say it with me: "The vaccine is safe and effective."
0	Because all side effects are being referred back to the vaccine makers   .... not any medical studies are being done
0	I literally just heard someone yesterday saying her whole family got vaccinated and they all got covid again. But yeah sure
0	First, let the government test it on themselves and after some time we’ll see if it’s so cool.
1	I am a psychology major who has seen the vaccine studies. They are proven safe and useful. There is no evidence for holding a counter position. Every educated adult in a science and medical field are in consensus about it.
0	I would NEVER vaccinate my kids
0	Heck no that shot is useless
1	It's so easy to argue against antivax, they are just dumb
0	If these vaccines are so safe why is the FDA and these companies who make these vaccines protected from any lawsuits and liability for 2 years?  If any company is not held accountable for their products then I don't want it.
0	Lab rats have no rights. Thats what we are if we take the vaccine
0	I had covid with no symptoms at all. My only proof being i looked after my husband for three weeks having covid. My feeling is that I had natural immunity . I never get colds or flhi. This leads me to believe that natural immunity to covid can last years and years.
0	This is experimental, it is Not a vaccine. Do your Research, you are nothing more than Lab Rats. I will never take the jab.
1	Fully vaxxed 💉 💉.  Aga Khan University Hospital is so so efficient. I was in and out in about 20 minutes (they had to replenish the vaccines before they got to me). I called ahead to find out their operating hours and if they had AZ. They told me they had AZ and Moderna
1	I understand there's a lot of evidence that we need to be conservative with our expectations for a vaccine, but I also don't think it's comparable to any sort of previous vaccine research.
0	What about those that have got long covid symptoms post vaccine, which are now called post vaccine long haulers??
0	The fact that they’re trying THIS hard to convince people to get that shot should scare the hell out of all of you.
0	If he’s taking credit for convincing kids to get vaccinated, he needs to be held responsible for it when consequences are delivered.
1	I totally believe in free choice of whether to get vaccinated but choices can have repercussions. If you choose not to get vaccinated and end up sick in the hospital with COVID, you should be billed for your time there, whether health care is normally free or not.
0	Natural immunity over artificial, plain and simple. Let’s not forget 99%+ survival rate
0	If you’re vaccinated why do you care you’ll be fine yourself.
1	In my country, vaccines were given stage-wise: 60+years and diabetics first, then 45+, then much later 18+. My husband got COVID before he got his turn of vaccination. It was not in our hands, but we really wished he had, it is a terrible disease. Later, like clock-work, he took his 1st and 2nd shots on the exact days as was prescibed, and things have slowly come back on track now. Arguing and fighting against vaccination is madness.
0	Wow. I feel the same way!!! All of these vaccinated people getting sick and having issues and I'm like what's the downside of not being vaccinated? The only one I can think of is.... I'm never sick. I don't understand how people don't see that the vaccine compromises their natural immunity.
1	I got my one-dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine today!
0	This is so stupid, the countries whit higher vaccination are the countries with more cases.
1	The US has like a surplus of vaccines and are even giving people incentives to get vaccinated, meanwhile in my country people are are trying their hardest to get vaccinated cause of scarcity. What a world we live in.
0	COVID IS AN OBVIOUS HOAX, THE VACCINE WILL KILL YOU, PERIOD!!
1	The vacine production needs to increase, its a race againt the clock..Is the Moderna and Pfizer vaccine really less efective against African variant?
0	You can't be forced to do anything. You ALWAYS have a choice.
1	This vaccine works! Yes you can still get it the virus being vaxxed but the sickness is WAY LESS then not being vaxxed
1	If you want to fly, go to concerts or play football, you have to do it sooner or later. indirect duty.
1	💕💕💕💕💕💕👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
0	Take precautions without taking vaccine.
1	As someone who had covid last year pretty bad, and also has bad allergies to normal things and medications I still chose to take the risk and get vaccinated. Thankfully no allergies to the vaccine and I’m so glad I got it. I would rather take a risk of having an allergic reaction to that than ever having covid like I did last year. It was so scaring not feeling like I could breathe and not knowing if I would wake up. I unfortunately have trumpanzees in my family who think it’s horrible that my immediate family got vaccinated even though they had covid last year as well but still deny it’s real
1	Officially boosted SyringeRed heartAdhesive bandage. Let’s all do our part . Get vaccinated or get your booster shot. We are all in this together!
0	I was told I was a conspiracy theorist when I pointed out to my friends that the four slots on their vaccine card were there for a reason and that they’d all be filled one way or another.
1	If the Oxford vaccine works, I'll take it
1	Please make vaccines mandatory. Please make vaccines mandatory. Please make vaccines mandatory. Please make vaccines mandatory. Please make vaccines mandatory.
1	as a former nurse I see nothing wrong with mask mandates and encourage everyone to get vaccinated.
0	Hahaha vaccine..... good one
0	This was ALWAYS the endgame for the antivaccine movement, to eliminate ALL vaccine mandates, including school vaccine mandates, in every state. I’ve been saying this for years, and I always knew eliminating #CovidVaccine mandates would not be the end.
0	No.. Because I don't trust. because vaccines take 5 to 10 years to make, not 9 damn months
0	I have 2 siblings that both have 2 kids ages 20 and 22. The unvaccinated 2 are brilliantly intelligent and very healthy. The 2 vaccinated have Autisim.
1	Could you be more stupid not to get the shot
0	As long as these huge pharmaceutical companies are making bank off the vaccine and Faulci is pushing the vaccines and getting a 350,000 retirement a year, there will BE never ending booster shots.
1	I am having severe side effects from the vaccine, guys. It's keeping me alive and ensures I have to go to work all day. How awful.
0	HUGE WIN! OSHA just withdrew its emergency COVID-19 vaccine mandate for private businesses. This is why we NEVER back down in the face of corruption.
1	my wife and I both work in healthcare. Unvaccinated are 5x more likely to transmit and catch covid. At my hospital we have 80 covid patients fighting for their lives. 95% of these patients are unvaccinated.
0	people are waking up on this deadly vaccine.
0	How exactly did they do the testing for it to tell us that?  If its safe enough then who is held liable if something goes wrong. Anybody?
1	If a person is anti-vaccine, they should be made to suffer, axiomatically. It's not even in terms of practicality, just morally, I think they should suffer. We already lock people up for murdering. With the state the world is in right now, you’re lucky we don’t arrest people for not getting vaccinated. Listen, it’s a global pandemic, people need to get vaccinated to stop the global pandemic, as long as they keep not getting the vaccine, thousands of people are going to die. Sorry, but if you disagree, that’s a (You) problem. And it’s not authoritarian because if you’re unvaccinated without a really good medical justification, you’re breaking the social contract and violating the freedoms of other individuals. The kids of anti-vax parents should be separated and the state should take care of them. That probably won’t happen, but it should. We should also have a human rights crimes tribunal for all the large media and political figures that have engaged in vaccine and covid-denialism.
1	i already got my first shot 2 days ago trust me its better than having covid
0	You don't need jabs. You still get it and pass it
1	I trust the experts.
0	I have taken every vaccines of various dieseases as prescribed age wise since childhood. But looking at numerous unreported side effects after vaccination in India, I am feeling tensed and skeptical about this one.
1	#Dont look up anti-vaxxers.
0	Don't waste your time on this interview. It is the same old information go around. He does not admit vaccines are failures and they do not explore alternative early treatments as a strategy.
0	COVID19 IS NOT A DISEASE; INJECTIONS ARE NOT LEGALLY, MEDICALLY A VACCINE; INJECTIONS ARE EXPERIMENTAL GENE THERAPY WITH AN IMMUNE SYSTEM CHANGING “TROJAN HORSE”; CAN BE USED BY WEALTHY ILLUMINATI TO EXTERMINATE HUMANITY !
0	It's truly corporate greed, why they didn't do buisnesses in another way instead of enforce employees to get vaccine
1	You can't get at people like that with facts.
1	The unvaccinated account for a much higher percentage of hospitalizations than the vaccinated and are more likely to have more severe symptoms or die. This in turn taxes the system, creates hardships for everyone, especially healthcare workers. It is not a liberal fantasy.
0	Blaming the unvaccinated for the ineffectiveness of the vaccines,boggles my mind...
1	Many experts in pediatric infectious disease, pediatric cardiology, epidemiology have looked very carefully at this data both within the FDA and the CDC, and are overwhelmingly confident that the vaccine is safe and effective for all the age groups for which it's authorized.
1	My grandmother (67) took single dose of vaccine two weeks ago and tested positive yesterday... She's asymptomatic and it's severity is quite minor...her vaccination surely did help her fight covid. She will soon take the second dose as well. I urge u all to vaccinate ASAP according to your eligibility.
0	After seeing two close friends get sick with covid after getting the vaccine I'm having doubts
1	The antivax will regret not getting it.
1	I got my booster shot of biontech vaccine 2 days ago. I hope everyone follow health official recommendations to protect us all against new variants.
1	If science sways you, the reason to use vaccines in clear. if it doesn't, then you are living in a choose-your-own-reality world
0	I have lost my job and ‘retired’ now because I am not vaccinated. I am a teacher and above 6o and I had been to all the busy places and I don’t have any symptoms or Covid (2 years now)
1	@jbkjames @OlgaNYC1211 @FDNY Naw. The 80% of the firefighters who are vaccinated are heroes. These unvaccinated ones don't have their co workers backs.
0	Unvaxxed and leaving Chicago to go to Florida! About to live my best life.
0	The only talk we get is VACCINES, VACCINES, VACCINES as the one and only salvation. That ought to make everyone very suspicious and very angry.
1	Been getting them for 56 years and I’m just fine.
1	Thank you for trying. I still can’t convince my brother to get the vaccine because he thinks he has “natural immunity” to COVID-19. Despite the fact that I’m a nurse and on the front lines of this nightmare, he won’t budge
1	The FDA gave the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine emergency authorization to use in children ages 5-15 years old and full approval to use in people ages 16 years and older.
0	If others are vaccinated, and the vaccine is so great and works so well, why does it matter if YOU are vaccinated?! This whole thing is absolutely ridiculous
1	I will be getting the third dose as soon as it’s available.
0	If you pay me 1 million I am still not getting jabbed
0	We are not puppets! My body . My blood!
0	again that's a lie. vaxxed are spreading covid just as much as unvaxxed
0	I hear #Novavax has been approved in Australia. Still not getting #vaccinated. Ironically, if the government hadn't pushed the #CovidVaccine so violently, I wouldn't have done so much research into #vaccines. I don't think I'll ever take a #vaccine again.
1	I’m taking my first dose on Friday :)
1	Getting vaccinated is being careful. Getting the virus is riskier for all age groups.
1	You're just upset the vaccines work.
1	I'm not anti vax and have all the regular vaccines we get in my country as kids but I'm not allowed to take the jab for my doctor.
0	covid-19 is a microship delivery tool
0	You know what’s freaking hilarious? The lady behind the desk is not wearing a mask inside, and the dude outside is wearing one LOL
0	I deeply regret my MRNA. Living with POTS caused by it at 40 is worse than having Omicron. Which, I've had too by the way, despite my status 🤗
1	I wish Thanos snapped all anti vaxxers instead of the avengers
1	Let’s prevent as much hospital overflow as possible. Get vaxed !!!!! Think about who you're going to displace who need hospitalization for a serious illness that wasn’t from Covid.
1	time to get ur vaccine
1	How many might have lived if they were vaccinated? A number too large.
1	My doctor prescribed my vaccination because of my health issues,  I haven't had any problems with the shot
0	You're allowed to question medicine. But not vaccines. Never vaccines!
1	There’s enough very fit people that have been made very very ill from Covid. Being super fit doesn’t let you off the hook - cytokine storm is very nasty
0	It’s not a vaccine, vaccines give you life long immunity. It’s a prophylactic therapeutic at best.
1	Humanity is on its way to achieve one of the greatest medical marvels in history. Really shows the true potential of human beings when we get our shit together and collectively work towards a goal.
0	I'm living FREE right now with no vaccine.
1	Nothing is stopping me from getting vaccinated against covid19. I am fully vaxxed now (Moderna/Pfizer). If a booster is recommended I will get that as well.
0	The doctor said there’s no reason for me to get a vaccination before my antibody numbers become almost nonexistent
1	I’ll take whatever is available ASAP. If the others prove more effective later, I can get re- vaccinated. Saving as many lives as quickly as possible is the important thing. I can’t wait to be protected. I have friends who have been very ill for many weeks. Yikes!
0	My father got vaccinated on 15th March, 2021 and some days later he started having hiccups and it lasted like 9 days then he died. He was a strong man with no serious health issue. 😊 god help humanity
0	I just don't trust it
0	LOT OF VACCINATED PEOPLE HAVING HEART CONDITIONS AND PREGNANT WOMEN HAVING MISS CARRIGAGES !😐😒😒
1	Reduce is the keyword there. Nothing will give you 100% protection but the vaccine is VERY effective regardless. Even if you do get infected after getting the shot, the risks of hospitalization and death is dramatically reduced.
1	I understand this vaccine hesitancy very well. Several months ago, my elderly mum stated her misgivings about the possible side-effects of vaccines. So I replied, which risk would you rather run,  the daily risk of getting (severe) covid, or a very minuscule chance of suffering adverse effects after vaccination. Well, in the end she and my dad have been fully vaccinated.  But my baby-brother is still on the fence...
1	The vaccines are effective at preventing high loads of viral replication i.e. serious death and complications in older people and those with comorbidities such as obese, diabetes, etc..
1	Shut your fucking mouth. Get your vaccine. Go the fuck home.
0	I have zero trust in big pharma. Zero trust in the government. Fuck a vaccine. The mrna stuff arent even vaccines. lts a brand new technology. And they are lying about what it is.
0	Quick question. Does the vaccine stop anything yet? Other than freedom?
0	My Immune system is better than this POISON
1	How was Polio eradicated? Vaccines. Everyone got a Polio vaccine and now the world does not have polio. If everyone got the covid vaccine (like all the vaccines during grade school) we would be in a much better place.
0	I don't see the problem. It is not like they were giving a fake shot to people without them knowing. The people that bought it needed/wanted it to save their job, retirement, kids and others with health conditions. There is definitely a market out there.
1	hes an anti vaxxer who paid the price for not having the vaccine
1	There are people who fear the vaccine because they don't know what it is and how it works.
1	Thanks Doc, getting my vaccine today. This helped alleviate alot of the concerns I have. Crazy the amount of anti-vax stuff online lately, really freaked me out
0	Great honest Doctor ! I’ve had 2 jabs, since having them I’ve had numerous Ill health problems, including blood clots, not having the boaster !
1	I can't wait to get my 16th booster shot to finally end this pandemic!
1	We have been getting Pfizer for months here in Australia. No issues, so far!
1	I m fine with a vaccine as long as they don t force it on people. I personally don t want it either. But it should be available for anyone who does want to get it.
0	we put so many things in our body that we have no idea what the ingredients are, or if they’re good or bad. I’d rather be safe then sorry
0	it seems like the only thing the vaccine does is perpetually ruins our society on a day to day basis..
1	THIS VACCINE BETTER GET HERE FAST CAUSE I NEED TO SEE MY BFF LMAO
1	God bless you for having the courage to do this story.  Thank you for the testimonies of those who have been hospitalized.  I hope they all recover and are able to go home to their loving families.  Yes! If not for yourself, then get vaccinated for your family! I am SO grateful to have been a part of the Pfizer study.  I am a woman of color, with underlying health issues and I am over the age of 60.  I cannot tell you what a blessing it has been knowing that I was able to help some people out there.  Peace to all of you.
1	Citizens who refused getting vaccinated are problematic but what really grinds my gear are the healthcare workers who refuse to get vaccinated too. It's even more irresponsible and really dissapointing..
0	No vaccine has ever been proven effective.
1	When the polio vaccine dropped in 1955 people lined up to get it, & we were 2 years away from artificial satellites. Now in 2021 we carry external world-brains in our pockets & there's robots on Mars and idiots think COVID vaccine is full of wizard poison.
1	m currently getting over covid and since i got the vaccine my covid is just like a cold, even my docter said it seemed like a cold, although it is scary to have covid, if you get the vaccine its not as bad, if you are not vaccinated, GET VACCINATED! its amazing how science has come so far. GET VACCINATED AS SOON AS YOU CAN!!! stay safe everyone and wear a mask
1	Vaccines should be mandatory
0	Any Parent stupid enough to put their children in a experimental dna altering jab program, does not deserve to have children.
0	The jabs definitely does Things just doesn't prevent infection or transmission. THATS HORRIFYIN
1	I think the point of Christopher's 70+ yo parents being vaccinated, getting COVID BUT surviving, while his 53 yo unvaccinated self did not, says EVERYTHING that can be said.
0	Because they aren't sheep!
1	F off
1	Everyone should get the vaccine, whether they have had COVID or not.
0	You know what's even safer for kids...no shot
0	Well I’m sure why! It means the vaccines doesn’t work, even I child would qualify to answer that!
0	My younger sister is a doctor and asked me if I wanted to get vaccinated for covid BS and I freaked out and told her NO. Her reaction was priceless.
0	The vaccine is shit. Eat real food, not processed crap, eat mostly meat and seafood, supplement with vitamin D3 and K2 and stay away from the vaccine.
1	I finally got COVID this week. I got Pfizer shots in April 2021 and a Pfizer booster in November 2021. This virus is really hitting me hard. Severe nasal congestion, fever, body aches, fatigue. I’m throwing the covers off because I’m too hot, then a short while later I’m shivering. Coughing and sneezing with sandpaper in my throat is miserable. This is the first time I’ve been sick since getting an Apple Watch and it has been interesting to see how my heart rate has been all over the place. I can’t imagine how sick I’d be without the shots. It was comforting to see the headlines yesterday that Pfizer and Moderna boosters are 90% effective at preventing hospitalization.
1	You just don't know how vaccines work. That's all. It is not a cure, it is a vaccine.
1	Brazil is approaching 1,000 deaths per day from Covid. The only protection is the vaccine, the mask ... Lula urges vaccinated people to convince others of the importance of vaccination …
0	If you’re a young person there is absolutely no medical need to get this treatment. If you do you’re putting yourself at unknown risk as the vaccines haven’t gone through the proper long term safety checks. Whatever you decide do not take the 💉 because you feel pressured.
0	Of course it's a basic human right NOT to be forcibly injected with an experimental vaccine. Absolutely disgusting.
1	I don't know about you guys but I'm super excited to get my 5th booster!!!!
1	My current stance on this is that vaccines are good
0	The vaccines being developed in the UK are bog standard vaccines - just antigens on an adenovirus. No different to what we get for the flu.
0	damn, the vaccine is so perfect they might as well say that it gives you eternal life.
0	I'm just gonna say what the baby killers say.... My body, my choice!!!!
1	The vaccine has been around and given to people for over a year now, if there were gonna be long term effects, they most likely would’ve already shown up. You don’t really see side effects that randomly show up after 3 years.
0	No they don't work. Is the answer.
0	Why should I get vaccinated to save pensioners when they vote for governments that increase the price of uni and decrease funding for all nationalised things I used so they pay less tax
1	They have gone through ALL of the safety testing and analyses as any other drug or vaccine brought to market previously.
1	That is great news. More people need to get the vaccine.
1	I got my vaccine 2 days ago and it was the Pfizer one, I only had a sore arm and a little headache and fatigue on the first day, on the second I only had a sore arm but now I barely feel it now, my 2nd dose is in 6 weeks
0	Take more beds off line  and keep manufacturing crises to better milk the taxpayers for billions rather than adding beds to reduce the "emergency". An effin' brilliant business plan supported and encouraged by the corporate state...an inverted  totalitarian oligarchy.
0	ALL my family queuing up for VACCINEs.. they won't talk to me for not getting it..
1	the virus has so far caused 2 million deaths worldwide. Not to speak of long-term damage. That's just the deaths. A thoroughly tested vaccination (yes, it is) can't be that bad.
0	A 16 year old has to have a vaccination pass to take the train, do sport, go to the museum... A non-immunising vaccine, generating serious side effects for a virus less serious than the flu. And we should keep quiet, isn't this a dictatorship?
1	A gut feeling doesn't weigh much compared to medical and scientific evidence. Get the shot.
0	Read everything you can before you make the BAD decision to get the vaccine. Remember, no clinical trials equals no vaccine that I’m going to take, It’s all a scam.
0	Zero side effects from covid, myocarditis from the faulty vax. Sounds like Pfizer punkd yall
1	Not gonna lie, this sounds stupid. Why would you NOT get the vaccine if it was available for you? I understand the concept of let the at risk people get it first, but Elon has a lot of people depending on him. If he goes down for 2-3 weeks, thats a big deal for his employees and companies.
0	My papa died from the cv shot! My pos mother told him he had to get it to see his GF of 26+ years. (She lied to him so he would get it!) He got it and his heart rate dropped below 50. He had to be admitted because his heart rate kept dropping. It killed him!
1	people are so willing to latch on to the latest rumours about vaccine side effects and ineffectiveness. Why is it so hard to see the real picture that having a vaccine that is PROVEN to be safe and effective after just one year of development is an entirely wonderous thing
1	Some are still dumb enough to think Covid is a hoax. 900,000 dead Americans know it is not a hoax but very real and deadly for those who least expect it. So many who refused to get vaccinated for a variety of idiotic reasons are now 6ft under and didn't need to be...sad!
0	It’s sad that people still can support vaccination with the amount of harm it has caused.
0	I’d rather die standing up for what I believe in, instead of from a slow horrible death from an experimental cocktail shot into my veins like a yes man.
1	Covid vaccination is now vital and necessary for our protection. Vaccination is a step forward to prevent the further spread of this pandemic.
1	share the evidence. I’ll wait. Until then, you’ve been found out as a compulsive liar. Thank you for showing your intentions to make virus worse for your own sick thrills
1	Lots of RED FLAGS. Why are they pushing this so much. They have evil intentions is why. Think about it. Wake up people.
0	Why are we the ones holding things back? You’re vaccinated.... go on with your life! I’ll still wear my mask and wash my hands all the time. You act like you have to wipe my ass. You don’t!
1	Getting the vaccine significantly reduces the likelihood of getting the disease, transmitting it to others, and if you get COVID your symptoms are reduced. It’s common sense to get vaccinated when you can.
1	I choose life! I choose the vaccine!
1	my dad, an metastatic cancer patient, just told me he might have had COVID but isn’t sure because he couldn’t afford a $50 rapid test or find a PCR.  i’m so fucking mad for so many reasons, but first and foremost bc people like my dad matter. mask up. get vaccinated. fuck.
0	You don't wanna take that thing..... they did not take enough time to develop it. your better off risking it with something that's slightly worse then the flu.
1	if you 16 or up I think you should get vaccine
0	I feel it is safer just to get the virus and move nature run its course, rather than this satanic plan that is going on.
0	#fuckMasks #vaccinehoax #DontSaveTheNHS
0	lol Fully vaccinated people are still dying and spreading the virus. Still bad side effects from the vaccine as well. Being unvaccinated does not mean infected. Vaccinated does not mean its saving lives, this is not about life saving, it's about tyranny,  control,  manipulation
0	I'm not planning to get the vaccine, I rather aquire immunity through infection. I think eventually we all will be getting it at some point.
1	Let’s just face it. The anti-vaxxers don’t understand that their actions have consequences.
0	I'm still not getting any shots, thanx anyways
0	I'm not in a fork in the road, I will not trust this vaccine.. its GAMBAL to get the vax.
0	oh no, vaccines are uncomfortable
0	So grateful to Steve James for pushing back against this vacine. As a nurse I have been told twice now I am deemed to loose my job the pressure has been immense. I could not sleep last night with chest pain caused by this nonsense. The main stream media are so sanctimonious in their interviews.
0	we don’t need the vaccine because we were previously infected with Covid-19 and have natural immunity to protect them
0	Transparency would be saying these vaccines are still on trial phases and they were just approved under emergency frame
0	So now "unvaccinated folks" are not "regular folks"? I never wanted to be "regular" anyway. 😉
0	Perhaps you guys can take the vaccine yourselves, and do a daily vlog showing your results. Cheers.
1	Congratulations  Oxford  AstraZeneca  the best vaccine the world thank you for everything
0	virus is man made, the pandemic was planned, the vaccine trials started before the pandemic:
0	Just wondering if people would have taken the jab if they had realised the total dead from covid was 17500 which isn't any worse than a bad flu year.
1	High vaccination coverage in a population reduces the spread of the virus and helps prevent new variants from emerging
1	Would think that everyone would want to take a vaccine that decreased the chances of dying by 99%
0	Unbelievable, the covidists even deny the official site of the Drees which clearly shows a negative effectiveness of the vaccine in the 0-19 years old over 1 year. I think these people are crazy.  They answer me with press articles.
1	The vaccine wasn’t rushed it was streamlined. This is what happens when scientists and doctors are given the funds, support, equipment and staff numbers they need
0	Make America Free Again! Just say no to Agenda 21!!
1	"But I don't know what's in it." Yes, you do. Just get vaccinated.
0	we have to learn to live with Covid.  Mask or not, vaxed or not! End the mandates!
1	Stay off media and don't overthink it. I know many people personally that have got it and are perfectly fine. Just relax. 😊
0	I will never trust someone that is forcing me to do something against my will.
1	Take your vaccines, they will protect you.
1	Yes, definitely if a vaccine for Covid-19 comes out I'll get it, because we all know, we can't live our whole lives locked down
1	Viruses will continue to mutate if they continue to spread. This is so frustrating that we can’t get this right as a nation. We have the privilege and access to the vaccine, for free.
1	and the 780000 dead from it would tell you to get vaccinated..
0	Ask labor and delivery nurses about the increase in old blood clots seen on the placentas in women covid vaccinated in their pregnancy.
0	I want to see every antivaccer try a dose of polio! See how that works out! Idiots!
1	I have a cancer, the vaccine is the safest way for me to protect my self
0	Rather have covid than take the vaccine
0	It’s all lies. This figures are all in accurate. Medical workers are for bidden to list the side effects from these vaccinations.
1	deaths are not the only bad outcome
1	My parents and my extended family will be vaccinated before I am as they all work as nurses at the biggest hospitals in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.
1	When I got the vaccine, it was just a one second pain. There’s really nothing to fear about
0	Australian unvaxxed here: I learnt to grow my own food and build with rammed earth and cobb. The amazing things you learn when you are forced out of society. Once you know how simple it is to live a good life you can only look at big cities with sheer horror.
0	The truth in history has never been accepted well because it threatens established systems, thinking, profit system, people’s careers, etc. Cigarettes and alcohol were approved by FDA… not every thing government approve and say it’s safe is actually safe.
1	I’m from Texas and pro-vaccination all the way. This is only a small percentage of Texas but it’s still very embarrassing.
1	the unvaxxed are marching.
0	Double vaxed friend aged 56, died two days ago. Got COVID and lungs damage and heart attack. Company mandated Vaccination.
0	Its almost like the "vaccine" was pushed way too quickly without enough testing?
1	Antivaxxers thick as bricks. Next they might tell you Jesus is coming back
0	The side effects are to large
1	At this point, if the vaccines work for the 6 months to under 5 age-group, let us get as many of these kids vaccinated as possible.
0	Democrats have blood on their hands, teaching my kids, spreading the word why their enemies are, Democrats
0	It's just every time I see news on this progress I get very hopeful and I need to know if I need to be more realistic toward this or if this indeed is something to be excited about?
0	Why get vaccinated.. you have three and are still sick and contagious Doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result is insanity!
0	Why would anyone take the shots ? Why ??? Proven to be useless and when they are feed us lies and scare tactics to get the jab. Open your eyes. It can't be good. We are free to choose what we take. There is an evil agenda here. We are free to refuse . If the vaccines are so good why are the fully vacced worries over us unvacced ?? Shows how brainwashed you sheep really are. Stand up and promote nonsense. Governments love sheep like the pro vaccers
1	We should thank the anti-vaxxers for their noble sacrifices. Their efforts will improve the national gene pool and elevate the public conversations with their increased absence.
0	Getting outside and exercising, eating right and watching my weight is my vaccine.
0	the fact that some people gladly show off their “Vaccine shots” on social media and are so glad, makes me wonder how different some people really are
1	I work in Pfizer, I worked on a part of the dev of this new vaccine, we have an high standard safe procedures, the vaccine is the best weapon against this virus
0	I’m not having another one had 3 ffs
1	I'm so very glad I'm vaccinated, I want to take part in community events and go to concerts and other things. Anti-vaxxxers are really quite disgusting people, I understand they have their concerns and they have their feelings and opinions, but attacking those of us who are vaccinated is wrong, totally wrong.
1	Vaccine is the only reason I recovered early from omicron
0	Just goes to show you just because you’re vaccinated doesn’t mean you can’t die I am not getting vaccinated
0	Why did Novavax take a year while pfizer only takes a few weeks to qualify for EUA? Doesn't it sound the alarm in parent's mind?
0	he probably would have remained unvaccinated. His wife and son, who appear to have avoided Covid-19, aren’t vaccinated either.
0	How can I feel secure if the government signed a full disclaimers for vaccine manufacturers in case of side effects??
1	Do the right thing and protect yourselves and those that are vulnerable
1	After more than twelve billion doses being given it's proven to be statistically safer than air travel.
0	It s not inconceivable that there is actually a deadly or at least serious respiratory flu and that a quickly developed vaccine reduces the severity.
0	Those vaccines will be used on the new lab animals called human children.
1	the expectation in government is that for the next few years people will need regular booster jabs to protect against new variants of covid, as with the flu jab
0	I am still going through INFLAMMATION from the Moderna vaccine. These should be a CHOICE! Not mandatory
0	Your obedience is prolonging this nightmare
1	The second phase of the COVID-19 vaccination drive to cover the frontline Corona warriors will begin today in Gujarat.
1	Thank you for being scientific with your answers. All your answers make complete logical sense. The videos on ideologies vs facts are more valuable as sources. Thank you for being one of them.
0	Vaccine manufactures having 0 liability for any type of harm means its 100% safe, got it.
1	Thank you to the researchers, collaborators, scientists and healthcare workers. Science saves lives, period.
0	Type "Covid Vaccine Injuries" in Telegram and see the number of videos of injuries and deaths individuals are reporting on on a daily basis after they've been vaccinated. Also deaths reported by spouses, parents and children. Can't all be a coincidence!
0	Vaccine immunity is not a real thing.
0	we don’t believe COVID-19 is a threat.
0	Vaccines just don't work. Another strategy would be welcome for your people and the world
0	Avoid the jab if you are healthy. Research safe and effective therapeutics.
0	Vaccines are not the best tool! Don't get vaccinated and don't get Boosted!
1	My parents both tested positive last 2 weeks. Both completed booster. Boleh berkebun(depan rumah) tanpa masalah. 1 week later, tested again. Negative. Covid-19 vaccine does not prevent you from infection. But it prevents from severe infection. Take your booster
1	Pls take all vaccines..u will be safe
0	I don't get how come so much proof there needs to be about this if it's so helpful
1	Vaccinations are among the most important and effective preventive measures available in medicine.
1	The issue is the longer we allow covid to circulate among the unvaccinated the higher the chance it will mutate into a variant that the vaccines are no longer effective against.
0	Nobody forces you to get your vaccines for school. You just can t go to a public school without them
1	I have been fully vaccinated as i have a compromised immune system and COPD among other things
0	This videos is AWSOOOOOOOME !!! Thanks guys. Got my daily dose of propaganda.
1	I'm enjoying seeing the "what if one of the 6/7,000,000 cases was you" responses about the vaccine now while most of the same people spent the last year touting the 99% survival rate number to justify doing whatever they please
0	The same has happened to my partner and daughter, tried this on both of them, and this video is true. And it is sticks on different parts of the body, my family have their ones around the chest area. I am not getting vaccinated. My family is aware of this. Would like to know what the heck is this experiment doing to my loved ones? This is abnormal.
0	But studies are showing the boosters don’t work against the variants…..
1	Every shot is another brick in the herd immunity wall.
1	I m have 2 doses of Pfizer no booster and have been exposed maskless getting the text message 5 times. I tested negative 5 times. Getting the booster in a week, I think the vaccine works. May not prevent you from getting it but clearly reduces the chances or symptoms. I do wash my hands every time I touch a door so there is also that.
1	Smartest thing to do when Russia wants to take over Ukraine. Ukraine needs defense. Our priority is to dump the unvaccinated who are willing to put their lives on the line for their country. Come on. They vax the shit out of those guys and gals already. Let them serve. We are already low on numbers in our military.
1	As of now this is just a giant anti-vaxxer street party, not much more. By Monday, most of the reasonable people will have gone home and then the real work begins for the police to clear out the diehards.
1	Vaccine doesn't save us from the attack of virus but give the power to fight and preventing from hospitalization or to be serious. so, if we are vaccinated, it mean there are less chances to be affected and hospitalization.
0	anyone who takes this is insane
1	Everybody have to make a step! I will take the vaccine shot next Monday! Not only for me but also to protect my parents
1	If you’re on the fence about vaccines at this point then I think you need your head examined.
0	Tentative good news. Vaccine being tested in China is showing the hoped for results so far, it produces antibodies in people who receive it and does not have bad side effects. It can move on to next step in trials with more people and see if these antibodies are effective at creating immunity to virus.
0	How is the vaccine safe after 4 years olds are having heart attacks?!
1	I will never understand the reluctance of people, especially nurses that refuse to get vaccinated.  People may have the right to choose, but they do not have the right to get other people sick
1	I trust my governament and you should do the same, the vaccines are the only weapon to stop this
0	Why does the country have watch people get the COVID vaccine
1	This amazing kid wanted to get her first #CovidVaccine with her amazing brother and sister on her birthday, and to share that birthday, and her cupcakes, with us. And this is why pediatrics is the best specialty ever. (with permission)
0	As long as the companies making the vaccines are shielded by a no liability clause, nobody should take the vaccine. ANY company should be held responsabile for the product or service it provides
0	Forget the so called "statistics" they use now, in my life the people who got vaccine and boosters got the most serious cases. The ones that didn't get serious cases got sick when they got the vaccines and the booster only to get sick again when they got COVID.
1	Booster Dose done too ! Plz get yourself Vaccinated today
1	I have friends who are nurses and doctors - they, along with the rest of the world are sick and tired of these loud mouth people who preach anti vaccines
0	If safe then why many people died after taking the shots?
1	I am absolutely behind the vaccine programme, the team at Oxford are heroes.
0	None of it, don't trust it. You will have vaccine regret.
1	I was a covid nurse last 6 months. What a challenge and joy when people got vaccinated!!!!
0	Switzerland memorial for the children who died from the Pfizer injection.
1	our government still says it is safe!!
0	I have 99.97 reasons why I’m not putting that shit into my body
1	My friend got gbs triggered when he contracted covid. Got hospitalized. Few weeks later went to get vaccine, no problem. Got second shot, no problem.
1	I am supportive of health services, the support they have provided in recovering the majority of any Canadians that have gotten sick, I applaud such resilience in their effort.
1	you should be getting the #COVID19Vaccine not just for you be for others, family and not family. you don't want to be a spreader of #COVID19 or the reason someone dies from the virus because you weren't vaccinated.
0	Plain and simple, my point of view is that I will never get the vaccine and I don’t recommend anyone gets it at all. However, I (28m) am a relatively healthy person, athlete, army. I had COVID recently and it kicked my ass for two days. It was only two days but I could see a much more fragile person not making it out as well as I did. The only reason I’m saying this is so that when you are arguing someone on the vaccine, don’t discount that COVID can at least be a real sickness. No worse than the flu mind you, but don’t give the person you’re arguing with any holes to poke because they are already likely insecure that they are asleep to the lies they have been fed and they will USE anything against you
0	I already had covid, so I'm immune. I don't need the vaccine.
0	My female friend got her vaccine and has not had her period since. Not pregnant. Take it as it is
0	If anything they would be begging ANY worker to work in the hospitals during a REAL pandemic, But of course they have to discriminate because Vaccine comes first before saving lives…
0	How’s it that my vaxxed homies stay catching rona??
1	I took my first today
1	Bless those getting vaccinated
0	I know people who have gotten the shot twice, and they still got the Coronavirus again. So the shot doesn't protect you.
1	"Were COVID boosters the plan the whole time!?" Is not the question... which is the exact problem with anti-vaccers.  It's literally attempting to suggest a conspiracy theory where there need not be one.  They shouldn't need to hold onto conspiracy motte and baileys if their position is the principled one.
1	Congrats to all the scientists who made this... all the lives it has saved. Now hopefully it will save even more
1	My dad after getting the vaccine just was tired more for a couple days! A billion times better than losing the biggest supporter in my life
0	@business I just read that there was more people in the hospital that were vaccinated than unvaccinated.  So I guess us unvaccinated need to be leary of catching from vaccinated!  People just need to live and quit being fearful!
1	Thank you. let’s prevent as much hospital overflow as possible. Get vaxed !!!!! Think about who your going to displace who need hospitalization for a serious illness that wasn’t from Covid.
0	Vaccines are full of ingredients that are unnatural and dangerous. Theres a vaccine for everything these days,wheres the vaccine for Cancer/ Aids.....all planned. Ppl can see through the Bullshit Dont underestimate ppl that think for themselves.
1	I just got the first vaccine. My arm is a little sore (the same amount of soreness I get from a flu shot). That's the only symptom. I feel perfectly fine otherwise!
0	How many shots before everyone starts glowing in the dark?
0	The same people bashing on me, or who they call “anti-vaxxers”, are the same people saying “my body my choice.” Pathetic.
1	As a 29 year old service Plumber that that got the vaccine the first week it was available to those my age I have 3 words to say to that;
0	1:52 "Highly effective..."??? Says EMA executive director. At what? Didn't UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson say... and I quote... "It won't stop you from getting Covid-19, it won't stop you from spreading Covid-19." So will somebody please explain how it can be seen as "highly effective". It's highly effective at making certain people extremely wealthy, but what else? Take a look at Britain's latest re-hospitalization figures for Covid-19 infection, for people who have been double-vaxxed. The official figures reveal, it's the worst it's ever been and getting worse! So the myth about the reduction of hospitalizations after vaccination has been blown off its pedestal by the blunt facts.
0	The problems the injectiins cause are intentional.
0	I am scared of the shot and everything that goes with it
1	PLEASE EVERYBODY, PLEASE GET VACCINATED AND GET YOUR BOOSTER SHOT, CAUSE MONTY G. WISH NOT TO SEE ANYBODY GOING THROUGH & FEELING LIKE I DO DUE TO HAVING COVID FOR REAL.THIS IS MY FRONT. I AM SO DEPRESSED
0	This is so freaking sick. It's only a matter of time before they make it available for unborn and new born babies. What the hell has happened to this world?
1	Got my pfizer vaccine 2 days ago and my arm really hurt on the first day, but it's getting better. Get ur vaccine yall and hope that this pandemic ends.
0	After I commented they have removed the tweet. I guess saying the vaxx is completely useless didn't go over well  #VaccinesWork
0	I really hope for the best that are getting 3 or 4 doses both mentally and physically. Especially for the children that don’t have a choice
1	I got vaccinated to get my freedom back
0	It is unheard of to vaccinate people by force for something so common as a new flu.
0	Good. Vaccine hesitancy is the mark of intelligence.
1	@tauhenare I’m very pro. I operate a BNB and I live with an extremely immunocompromised husband and a grandchild too young to be vaxxed. I cannot risk taking guests at their word as to whether they’re vaxxed or not.
0	I wont be getting the Covid vaccine (for reasons)
1	Just give it to me already
1	unvaccinated people should have to deal with passports and masks, people who did the right thing should not be punished.
1	I'm "almost" ready to get this vaccine
1	So many people, just scared of a tiiiiiny needle...
1	it's your choice but it's definitely not poison. I'll agree not enough time has passed but vaccines are a crucial part of our life expectancy today and why our children are not paralyzed for life.
0	The CNN host Brianna said she can’t wait to vaccinate her already naturally immune 3 year old. I feel sorry for her child, having to be part of this experiment. My kids got Covid and their symptoms were sneezing for one day. Maybe her child has severe health issues? Then I would understand.
1	Vaccines just trick your body into making its own armor without you actually catching the virus. How is that a bad thing exactly?
0	Not taking this. Not worth the risk. Already in a low-risk group.
1	I’ve got my first Pfizer vaccine, I have a immune disorder, asthma and smoked for 20 years but quit 6 months ago. I had no difficulty at all on first vaccine. I’ll be getting second in less than 3 weeks.
0	No how do journalists even think they have the authority to tell us what to do
0	I took the vaccine yesterday and I got the worst migraine of my life today. The night followig the vaccination I felt chills the whole night and was freezing even with two thick hoodies on. I regret taking it so fkn much as I was completely fine before and I never got sick with covid these last 2 years
0	This is Not a 'vaccine';  it is an injection of the spike protein designed to produce a robust anti-body response .. a poor substitute for the true immunological response triggered by an actual vaccine.  However, the spike protein has failed to remain in the arm area as it was designed to do and instead it rapidly collects in the spleen.  Not good.  Then gets right into the Lymph system and invades all major organs with Spike protein.   Frankly, you have to be kind of ignorant and naive to submit to a still very experimental injection of a known pathogen
1	I'm Vaccinated because I Love My Neighbor as well as My Self!
0	I am more than convinced to not have this vaccine!
0	How many safe blood clots has it caused to healthy people? So safe the pharmaceutical companies are not liable for any side effects. Works so well people have to wear masks. Yeah, safe and effective my ass.
0	I did not get the Covid vaccine somethings not right about it now I know it’s in the vaccine you never explained that she put Covid and the vaccine
0	Cience says the vaccines do not prevent transmission, do not prevent getting sick and they do not prevent against omicron. Why get vaccinated?
1	Another week, another school notification, another child tested positive for COVID in the classroom. We have lost 348 lives to #COVID & had 270K infections in #TX21 for the month of January. Do your part: get vaccinated (boosted), wear a mask, avoid crowds, & wash hands often.
1	the level of immunity provided by the vaccines after having COVID-19 is higher than the level of immunity for those who had COVID but were not subsequently vaccinated.
0	I'm not for the covid vaccine because the evidence doesn't add up to that being necessary in order to survive.
1	I am OK with the vaccine, forcing or coercing people to take it against their will is just wrong. If someone tried to do that to me, something really upsetting might happen to them.
0	Oh, a toxic cocktail. Just what we need more of
0	No this is not a joke.   Dan hasn’t even mandated the “booster” yet and the MSM is already buttering you up for the 4th.  Please snap out of your trance. It’s been 2 years so far. Blind Freddy can see what’s happening.
1	“they’re not telling us what the vaccine is made out of” when i got the pfizer vaccine, i received a packet that included the ingredients, common side effects, tips, etc.
0	Yeah nope. Not shooting up some mystery vaccine
1	Show the world that you are vaccinated
1	YES, of course, I will take the Covid-19 vaccine! With pleasure and no fear!
1	Lack of education and lack of the ability to think critically is truly shinning during this pandemic.I have a cousin who has all these ''arguments'' too. Our shared cousin is a doctor, she's a trustworthy person. And even she can't do anything, seems like there is no light in the head. She has tried to explain in many ways, nothing clicks. She sees some conspiracy there and that's it. It's so sad.
1	People who do not want to be vaccinated, even though there is nothing medically wrong with it, take the rest of society into custody.
1	I got the vaccine there's nothing wrong with it
0	lies. Look into how many vaxxed people are still spreading covid and doing so without symptoms. Also, look how many are still catching covid with the wonderful vaccine
1	I loved this video. It seems like those unvaccinated people are causing lots of issues for the world when it comes to covid. People that can get vaccinated should, but then it’s their body and their choice. All this research with vaccines is really truly incredible and it seems that one day such diseases may not really hurt as much in the future.
1	i got Covid about a week after my booster! I only had a stuffy nose,a dry throat, minimal cough and fever. so greatful for the vaccine
0	I wonder where the mountain of information that proves this vaccine to be “safe” could be. It’s most people’s understanding that 6 to 7 years of clinical trials are standard practice before any assumptions of safety are made.
0	Why would you trust the government? Big Pharma has ZERO liability if the vaxx/booster injures or kills you!!! #bloodclots #VaccineSideEffects
1	Just got mine today, Pfizer , no symptoms at all
0	Pretty sure this will be mandated as soon as they pass out some stock options to the politicians
1	Vaccinated twice and had a booster! Feeling great…hope it works on any new variants like omicron
1	Got my #BoosterDose #BoosterJab
1	I have had both vaccines, caught COVID and had no symptom which is unusual because my breathing and immune system gets bad with a cold.
1	no one is accepting it’s endemic except Denmark who has a much higher vaccinated population than other parts of the world.
1	I hope everyone is safe and well! We can get through this pandemic together <3 just get vaccinated
0	I've been vaccinated 3 times, but I don't see the point in compulsory vaccination. It does not prevent infection or transmission. Only those who do it voluntarily and to "protect" against severe courses should vaccinate themselves.
1	Fortunately, I felt fine after my first shot recently, you should all do it
1	had Moderna aswell honestly being vaxed works both parents have recently had it real bad and ive been next to them and everything and i never got sick
0	Yeah my grandma 64 died 3 weeks after getting the vaccine
0	I, for one, will refuse the 'rona vaccine
0	Imagine a "Vaccine" so Safe you have to Force People to take it.
0	If the protected need protection from the unprotected, then the protection isn't doing its job.
0	Real title: “should we allow pharmaceutical companies the ability to force their products on and dictate policy through unconstitutional powers to the general populace without any liability?”
0	Yeah, I’ll avoid that poison...
0	If it worked the vaccinated wouldn’t have to worry and if it worked you wouldn’t forced
1	I’m all for covid-19 vaccination
0	The vaccine is the virus itself. They're trying to enforce it in the U.S. and Canada as well.
1	Get Vaccinated today.  #NOVACCineNoTrophy #RafaelNadal #AusOpen
1	Can’t cop my booster until March, that hurts.
0	Francesco Lollobrigida Member of the Italian Parliament: 'I have had the covid, I have had 3 vaccines, including the booster, but today for the swearing in of the President of the Republic I have to take a test. What does that mean? That the Green Pass is useless!
1	my mom works in a hospital and is getting her vaccine next Friday!
0	The immune system is much smarter than all the scientists put together.
1	Funny, but vaccine passports are scary. Who was it that said he who values security over freedom deserves neither?
0	actually vaccines can hurt and lower the immune system
0	Vaccination after COVID19 is pointless. Natural Immunity will always beat vaccination.
1	I convinced my parents to get vaccinated the soonest they became available in the Philippines. They are well and good, my father even went for the booster himself. I hope we also think about other people and get vaccinated.
1	Vaxxed, boosted and masked up when we need to...we are part of the solution
0	I am sorry but any parent who takes their healthy child for a covid vaccine at this stage is mental
1	I'm happy to get a vaccine that is FDA approved and provides eradication of a deadly virus....
1	Can't say I feel much sympathy, They were given ample opportunity to get vaccinated and did not and are now suffering the consequences
1	I got a sore arms for a few days and that was it. All of this wailing for nothing. I would still never tell my mum I had it done though, don't want to deal with that conversation!!
1	I have Covid, glad I've had the vaccines because even with them this thing is not good.
0	I am waiting to see one of these ;people get the shot and flop like a landed fish.
1	I can't believe people are coming here to spew anti-vax agenda... just get vaccinated ffs
0	Nor do I get vax bc I have heart issues
0	I once petted a lion, he bit of my hand. Now i recommend others to do the same.
0	Don’t do it yall
0	Some people think for themselves and would rather take their chances after 10 months of still being alive by NOT participating in rushed and untested vaccine. Like, duh
1	for people who already had COVID-19, those who do not get vaccinated after their recovery are more than 2 times as likely to get COVID-19 again than those who get fully vaccinated after their recovery.
0	No, no, it's got to be 99% triple vaxxed and you still have to wear a N95.
0	WE SAY NO! IT'S OUR HUMAN RIGHT!
0	Anyone who puts this into their body is certifiably crazy!!!
1	That is very sad,but remember thousands of people all around the world have died of the disease.The vaccine gives most everyone a fighting chance.
1	nurses being antivax is a dereliction of their responsibility to look out for the well-being of the people they are taking care of and we are in a global health crisis, that is not my opinion; this is real whether people want it to be or not. This virus is an incredibly contagious respiratory disease and nurses, of all people, should be socially responsible enough to do their job correctly. If I found out some idiot nurse gave a family member Covid I would come unglued. You'd think that, especially watching all of this carnage happening right before their eyes 40+ hours a week, they would take it more seriously.
0	The biggest question is, why are you trying to force something on me I don't want?
1	The vaccinated are in good shape. The unvaccinated are going away at 75,000 a month.
1	I can not take the vaccine because of my immunity system, you are lucky you should not waste this occasion of protect yourself from this fucking virus
1	COVID-19 vaccines will be an important tool to help stop the pandemic.
0	The vaccine doesn't work because the Earth is flat😄
1	My husband's coworker died yesterday. Unvaxxed, early 50s. He'd been in the ICU for weeks and intubated for around 2 weeks. Couple of adult kids and one in high school. So pointless.
1	If vaccination is what can bring life to normal again, then just do it
1	Couldn't you think of a portmanteau abbreviation for Anti-Vaxxers?
1	I got my second dose of Pfizer 12 days ago. Little symptoms just slight body aches and one night of bad sleep. I am very happy to get a vaccine and to not risk getting Covid and having to quarantine for 10 days.
0	Vaccine and masks aren't working!
0	To all that are saying “unvaccinated people will go maskless and it is a risk to me, even though I’m masked and vaccinated:” what is your solution? Wear masks forever?
1	I recently got my second dose of Pfizer. Didn’t hurt as much as the first. I don’t exactly feel completely invincible but damn does it help.
1	Yes because experts believe that getting a COVID-19 vaccine may help you keep from getting seriously ill. It may also protect you and protect people around you.
1	Exactly the reason I got vaccinated. Cheers.
0	Please church leader help us to stop thise vaccine
0	The vaccine clearly doesn't work. Not only that, it is becoming abundantly clear that it is doing more harm than good for healthy young people.
1	Why do Unvaccinated people seek help at Hospitals for Covid care?
0	Personally I’m not taking the jab if anybody wants my vaccines you are welcome to them enjoy
0	What’s shocking to me is the lack of help people face with these adverse reactions. It’s appalling.
0	I think "medical treatment" (vaccines) should be a matter of choice, and it shouldn't be forced ... my humble opinion
0	My father got vaccinated on 15th March, 2021 and some days later he started having hiccups and it lasted like 9 days then he died. He was a strong man with no serious health issue. god help humanity
0	Still yet to see, hear or read of ONE person dying in the street due to this 'killer virus'
1	Vaccine works!
0	“I believe in vaccines”? Sounds like a faith based religion. Are there any bad vaccines? I believe in hamburgers"
1	Instead of giving air time to hate, let’s focus on what’s great! It turns out  Jabapalooza gave a total of 12,000 doses of  CovidVaccine between April 2021 and now. It was moment after moment of community coming together, advocating together, being truly proactive together.
0	Not vaccine but pure love
0	We haven’t lived long enough to see the long term effects of the vaccine on people’s health and fertility. I think that if that is your reason to not get the vaccine that is understandable and should be respected, especially considering this vaccine has been created much faster than for other diseases. In average it takes 5 years to develop a vaccine and this took about 1.
0	This is a not a regular vaccine, it is an RNA Vaccine which is going to make a mess with your DNA, nothing we experimented before. Should you be concern? Well what we know about it? We will need at least 10 years of testing before to know about it. i personally say no, can be very dangerous and I won’t do it at all.
0	Unlike covid, I actually do know someone who died suddenly 2 weeks after their second covid vaccine shot.
1	i am incredibly thankful and excited to receive the covid-19 vaccine. i choose to get vaccinated for my family
0	I have under lined health conditions and I will not be having this vaccine
0	Interestingly enough, everyone I know who isn't vaxxed hasn't caught omicron yet and at least a quarter of the people I know who are vaxxed have it right now.
0	I lost a female family relative recently. I think vaccine effects are more severe than the covid itself.
1	I'm getting a vaccine shot soon who else is getting it soon
0	Some think especially in the West that everyone should be repeatedly vaccinated, but such forced vaccinations actually weakens everyone in the future. It is no surprise that many succumb to new variants and viruses in Europe and USA - unlike in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Natural immunity is generally still the best immunization if you have a strong body
0	Do not take the vaccine it will kill you
1	My main issue is that the same people that think that the vaccine is unsafe because less than 1 in 1,000,000 have had a side affect, were the same people touting that 99.9% of people that get covid are fine.
1	Its tragic she speaks for so many like her who a pro vaccine.
1	I am glad to have both of my children vaccinated!
1	Getting vaccinated for COVID-19 can help stop other variants from emerging
1	Vaxxed and voted…!
1	I was on the fence, and now I'm more on the side of pro vaccine.
0	Why isn't this "vaccine" providing complete and lasting immunity? I got all my childhood vaccines and never had to double up on them or get boosters forever. Something sinister is happening here.
1	As a healthcare worker, I'm incredibly excited that my wife (also healthcare) and I may get vaccinated in the next couple of months.
0	Pretty fantastic start to do 137K in the first week without really being able to specifically plan and schedule for it.
0	By no means am I an #antivac person. BUT, let the record reflect that there's no way I'll get an untested, unproven #CovidVaccine aka #TrumpVaccine within the first 2 years. I'd rather #StayAtHome and #StaySafe. This disaster will ONLY get worse.
1	It is panic-driven recklessness.
1	I would not want to be treated by an unvaccinated healthcare worker. If they won't do something simple like get a vaccine, what other safety measures are the not following.
0	The vaccines are useless!
1	Ugh… at this Point, just let them. Maybe there will be less stupidity in this country
1	A lot of people aren't at risk of dying from the flu, but we tend to get flu shots. It helps those that ARE at risk and also happen to fit in the small percentage where the vaccine doesn't work.
0	How can I feel secure if the government signed a full disclaimers for vaccine manufacturers in case of side effects??
1	Good, the more vaccinations the less opportunity for the virus to mutate and create variants
1	It’ll end when these JackA$$$ would get vaccinated and wear there mask 🤦🏽♂️
0	JESUS HAS THE LAST SAY SO I PRAY WE FIGHT AGAINST THIS MANDATE ! This is our body OUR CHOICE WE HAVE TO FIGHT!
0	The only misinformation is the claims the jabs are 'safe and effective'.
0	Do not take the vax
1	This was a very informative video. I knew that the COVID-19 vaccines were mRNA, but I never truly understood how they worked. Thank you for enlightening me TedEd in a beautiful and well-explained video.
1	I know that there is more work to do to repair the frustration and fatigue in our country as a result of the pandemic, but we have come a long way in one year. Life-saving vaccines and an increase in our supply of tests are helping us get on track to moving beyond the pandemic.
1	“They’re not telling us what the vaccine is made out of”… are you going to genuinely sit here and tell me you know what every other vaccine like childhood vaccines are made out of? I’m sure most people didn’t questioned those.
0	My immune systom is 100% better and worth a lot more than to take the risk to take something with no garentee. God made me with His immunity and that is a garentee.
0	I don't know whether that applies to the 5- to 11-year-olds.
0	“MYTH: The technology used to create the COVID vaccines is too new to be safe.” This is not intellectually honest, people are concerned with the safety of the mRNA vaccine since these vaccines have not been previously used in humans and have never been used for mass immunization. Twisting the words to make it easier to falsify the claim is a classic strawman argument
1	What a idiot , says it all about the ANTI VAXXERS
0	Great, since the other 3 doses didn’t work, hopefully this 4th one will
1	He is willfully refusing the vaccine? If that the case he is putting someone other people at risk and possibly waste a heart. Isn’t there clauses that alcoholics can’t receive liver transplants?
1	God bless those workers working 24/7 to find a cure and vaccine
0	They want everyone vaccinated thats bullshit. My unvaccinated gang is here to support me.
1	I got the vaccine because I couldn’t carelessly cause someone harm. Whether it was a friend, family, or someone I disagree with or even dislike. Getting vaccinated shows a cohesion as Canadians to do the right thing.
1	After the shots, you might experience a sore arm, a mild fever or body aches, but this doesn’t mean you have COVID-19. These symptoms, if they happen at all, are temporary, usually lasting only a day or two.
1	I had the vaccine to save my life for been an elderly person my lungs might not be up to strength to fight off the covid 19.
0	The vaccines don’t work and do more harm than good
1	The epidemic is subsiding. Let's keep going, get vaccinated!
0	I’ll never get the trump vaccine
0	I had distrust with this whole thing when they shut down churches and gyms and schools but kept McDonald’s and Walmart’s open
1	I just got my COVID vaccine behind my parent's back and it feels great.
0	It's well known in medical circles the vaccine makes your immune system weaker! Don't take it Never had it never will bc I don't get fearful; I trust in my Lord and savior Jesus Christ
1	I have gotten to the point where I don’t have any sympathy for anybody that spreads misinformation about the vaccine at all. I am very tired of them continuing this pandemic.
0	the horrible side effects from this shot are much worse for us, personally.
1	It’s time people realize that vaccination will safeguard them from this virus
1	Let's see, incubation time for Omicron is about 3 days so wait for it, people. You should start feeling crappy about Wednesday. Hope you enjoy your long COVID as well.
1	I'm blessed to be vaccinated as I just recovered from COV in 7 day without severity symptom. My mom full vaccinated with booster 65 this year is lucky enough to recover from COV just 3 days. I think is better get vaccination least reduce the severity symptom like pneumonia as may damage your lung or worse...
0	Even after receiving the vaccine, people are still getting COVID!!! NO THANKS!!
0	How many adverse reactions has this vaccine caused?  And how many total deaths?  Please let people know this info before they get injected
1	Do these people seriously think all of their local doctors and nurses are part of a global CONSPIRACY??
1	Thanks Moderna! I just finished my second vaccine dose; I was expecting side effects so I took the day off. I was fine & ended up completing all my yard work. One Aleve took care of my arm & I had no other side effects.
0	The real question here is WHO TF is offering up their kids for these trials? You couldn't pay me enough to risk my infants life on a pharmaceutical trial. That is absolutely insane.
1	Vaccines do work. I suggest that everyone who is eligible for a COVID@vaccine should get one. I can tell you , I would not sacrifice my health or employment for freedumb.
1	Since this pandemic I've personally lost around 16 people between me and my partner. None were vaccinated and I still don't understand why people aren't choosing to live vs ending up in the hospital or dead.
0	My body my choices... NATURAL IMMUNITY is best... 99.97 recovery rate says all
1	Scientific data is there for all to see. There is overwhelming evidence the vaccine does more good than bad.
0	no to vaccines
0	Dozens of countries have either halted distribution or banned the vaccines altogether due to serious side effects linked with the jab. This thing was rushed without animal trials, no long term studies etc. Hesitancy is completely justified.
1	Vaccines can save children’s lives.
0	70% of all omicron cases are the double and triple vaccinated. The vaccinated are spreading omicron. They're endangering everyone else now.
0	Not at all in such a corrupt evil world, NOT! Vaccines always contained malicious ingredients and ulterior motives!  Must boycott al synthetic Rx and warn others! :(
1	I’m a 65-year-old female and had my 2 Moderna shots 4/16 and 5/14. My 75-year-old husband refuses to get his. Oh, well; guess I’ll be widowed a second time. This time, from his sheer stupidity.
0	I personally don't trust the vax, nor have I ever trusted corporate media and the government.
0	Hey riddle me this , if your vax does not stop you from catching and or passing it how is it slowing down the spread , I'll tell you it's not that's a fact . It's fine to take it in my mind why not if you want to risk your life go ahead . But for me no . And simply because it does not stop the spread . Does any one get that . You can still get it and pass it and that's a fact period . Your not saving anyone by getting it . Only yourself that a solid selling point . But it's a risk again , covid can kill you too . So it's a hard one in my mind
1	In this pandemic wear mask in public places and get vaccinated it will be safe for you also inspired other too
0	A good friend of mine passed away from a massive heart attack the day after her second Covid shot. She was otherwise very healthy.
1	And also allowing the virus a better environment to mutate and make the vaccine less effective in the long run, ensuring that covid will be around for a long time instead of eliminating it when we had the chance.
1	Anti vaxxers literally don't understand how vaccines work and put unrealistic expectations on how they should work. Like owning a fire extinguisher and expecting to never get fires again and when it doesn't do that, theyre worthless. How completely naive.
0	MY WIFE HAD THE EXACT SAME!!! She is 3 months sick and desperately trying to get answers. We are in Ireland and we are paying for specialists now.
1	I don’t understand what is happening here. 2yrs ago Joe Rogan supported & was behind the science of vaccine. Now he’s not. WTF happened?
0	Fantastic result, but it'd be premature to think that it's actually 100% effective against severe COVID-19.
0	Although I am fully vaccinated, I would refuse a third vaccination due to the most severe side effects.
0	Do your research and decide for yourself, don’t let anyone pressure you. Based on my lengthy research the answer is definitely no for taking the vaccine!
1	I'm not anti vax, as people love to say, I'm pro choice, for every medical choice there is. It's up to you, just make educated choices. I honestly don't know how people are even arguing otherwise.
0	Too bad you don't know if it helps stop the spread.
0	Natural immunity works too
0	Typical government propoganda to try and coerce you into having the Special Sauce injected into you, Don't go to the devils table all they will hand you are there scraps
0	So sad that my poor fellow coworkers in the medical field went from HERO TO ZERO in less then a year just because they refused to get vaccinated
0	Still not working for me I will wait 2 to 3 years see how many people died because of it
0	Vax takers are like drug addicts
0	No domestic travel for unvaxxed citizens but they’ll leave the boarder wide open
0	Many hospital trusts reported excess staff illness from catching covid... most in the vaccinated portion
1	got my first dose of Vaccine , this can be a help to my country
1	Thing that never get old: Making fun of anti-vaxxers Their children
1	I got my first covishield vaccination thanks to our government..my question is how long does this vaccination work or will be effective?
0	He’s got greater risk of myocarditis from the shot than he does risk from Covid. Congrats I guess?
0	I'm no longer an organ donor. If my body isn't good enough to receive a transplant because I decided not to get the vaccine, it isn't good enough to donate either 🤷♀️
1	get vaccinated! had my first with no side effects and looking forward to getting my second tomorrow :)
0	It's Fri 2/7/22 now we can say vaccines were not the ultimate answer for Covid-19.😭😭😭
0	Me and my family are 100% safe of any side effects from the COVID vaccine.  We haven't had it !!.
0	Everyone I know who’s been vaccinated keeps getting sick over and over and the ones who haven’t only got sick once. Doesn’t take a Trump supporter to figure this one out
0	Covid vaccines don't prevent transmission of the virus so you're knock of natural immunity holds no water. All studies show NI superior to vaccine. Deal with it.
1	People who refuse to get vaccinated are the reason we are back to wearing mask. Sad.
0	The vaccine is full of poison shit. Not good in any way for the human body
1	The best moments of my life in 2021 were the few seconds when I got vaccinated, because I value my life.
1	Once you get the vaccine, you get better
1	Imagine getting rid of the pandemic  just for anti vaxxers to bring it back
0	I love the way that it states we all have responsibilities to others but forgets to include that big pharmaceuticals have completely side stepped that responsibility themselves so rush this through.
0	ADHD is a side effect
0	Also even myself, i had my own similar experience where my vaccinated friend got it and I was with him 12 hours before his symptoms showed. Maybe all their immune systems are shot?
1	I had a fever and fatigue with both doses :/ I was not expecting that for BOTH doses for a whole day. I felt pretty bummy not gonna lie lol. But I'm glad I did it just so I can be part of the herd immunity community so we can go back to normal as fast as possible.
0	#covid is another big page in the world of extermination of people through vaccination. #Pfizer asked for a moratorium until 2076 on clinical research papers.
1	I m all for vaccine use (already had my first shot) but I agree that nobody should be forced to take it. Encouraged, even incentivized, sure; forced no.
1	In other breaking news, fish can't cook omelettes...The vaccine's purpose is not to prevent infection outright but to prevent severe breakouts thus lowering risk of hospitalisation and death.
1	Having a hard time squaring how you can be religiously opposed to a Covid vaccine, but took the anthrax, small pox, yearly flu, typhoid, yellow fever, MMR, etc to join and remain in… and that not have violated your “religion?”
